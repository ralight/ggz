	* src/msgboxi.c: - if an error message is not found, display the
	raw message instead of an empty   box.
	
	The tricky part here is that the strings should better not be used
	for comparison at all because they might contain locale-specific
	reasons (like: host not found: <reason>).  But for now this
	workaround should do it.

	client

2002-10-21 03:44  jzaun

	- made to compile again with ggzcore changes.

2002-10-20 00:02  jzaun

2002-10-16 02:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: Improvement (hopefully :-) to acinclude.ggz.  Now
	each GGZ check takes two optional parameters.  For instance:
	
	  AC_GGZ_LIBGGZ(action-if-found, action-if-not-found)
	
	'action-if-found' will be evaluated if the specified module was
	found.	'action-if-not-found' will be evaluated if the module is
	not found.  This is consistent with other autoconf macros.  If
	'action-is-not-found' is empty, then an error will be emitted if
	the module isn't found.  If 'action-if-not-found' is "ignore", then
	the module will simply be ignored if it's not found.
	
	This is not entirely backwards-compatible, since "ignore" used to
	be the first parameter to the macro.  But this way is more
	consistent, in my opinion.

2002-10-14 22:34  jzaun
