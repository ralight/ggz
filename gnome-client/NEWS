Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.7!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players
(quite a few game support statistics now).

Features in this release:

- Gtk+ clients and games have been ported to Gtk+ 2.x
- a new package: SDL games, currently including TicTacToe3D and Geekgame
- another new package: GNOME 2.x core client
- table chat, to communicate with your team members or opponents
- enhanced security through hashed passwords and encrypted connections
- improved integration with the meta server and web-based player statistics

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with the
GGZ client.
