==================================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - GNOME client - Version 0.0.8
==================================================

This is the GNOME core client for GGZ.
It does not support all the features yet, but is
usable already and should encourage people to try it out.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
For an overall view on the GGZ setup procedures, please consult the file
README.GGZ.
Have a look at QuickStart.GGZ to learn about the installation process.

If you encounter any bugs, please send them to the mailing list,
	<ggz-dev@mail.ggzgamingzone.org>.
Or use the bug tracker at http://bugs.ggzgamingzone.org/.

Have fun!
