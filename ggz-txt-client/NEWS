Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.6!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players (at
least it will someday!)

Features in this release:

- Direct TCP connections provided for games.
- Game spectators (watch other people play!)
- Removal of 8 player limit per game
- KDE applications and games ported to KDE 3
- Many, many bugfixes
- See http://ggz.sourceforge.net/docs/release.html for details

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with the
GGZ client.
