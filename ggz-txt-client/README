This core client is not only useful for environments where no graphical desktop
is available, but does also serve as a reference implementation of the ggzcore
functionality.
 
Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
For an overall view on the GGZ setup procedures, please consult the file
README.GGZ.
 
If you encounter any bugs, please send them to
