====================================================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - KDE Clients, Tools and Games - Snapshot 0.99.4
====================================================================

This package contains the foundation for online gaming on the KDE 4
desktop. It replaces the previous packages ggz-kde-client and
ggz-kde-games from KDE 3 times.

It is required to install the kdegames package to compile the game
clients. This will as well get you more GGZ-enabled KDE 4 games.

Contents of the ggz-kde-center package:
	- kggzcore, a C++ KDE/Qt wrapper for the ggzcore library, serving
	  as a base for GGZ core clients
	- kggzdmod, a C++ KDE/Qt wrapper for the ggzdmod library, used
	  in game server development

	- plasma-kggz, a Plasma widget to receive invitations for
	  games and join them with a core client
	- kgrubby, a configuration utility for the chatbot Grubby

	- ktictactux, the well-known GGZ example game Tic-Tac-Toe,
	  in a fresh look for KDE 4
	- kdots, a Connect the Dots game client, now ported to
	  KDE 4 and with better savegame support
	- kryds, a game server for Tic-Tac-Toe using kggzdmod

Most of them have their own README for more information on them.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
