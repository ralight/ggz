Social Gaming/Social Network integration
----------------------------------------

Vencedor is a web service-enabled application which can synchronise user
actions between the web (i.e. GGZ Community portals) and the desktop.
All of these synchronisations should be subject to privacy control.

In order to make it work, Vencedor must be compiled with the Lokarest
library.

Currently, the following preferences are subject to synchronisation:
- players: buddies and ignored players
- rooms: favourite rooms
