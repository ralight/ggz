The GGZ Gaming Zone - KDE Game Modules
======================================

We are proud to say that there are now some KDE games available
for the GGZ Gaming Zone. Some of them are just other frontends
for existing games, others are completely new ones.

Content of GGZ-KDE-Games:
	- KReversi:
		A two-player game which is compatible with its Gtk+ brother.
	- Krosswater:
		KDE port of the Java game "Cross the Water". For two - four
		players.
	- KDots:
		Connect the Dots for KDE. Compatible with the Gtk+ version.
Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.

If you encounter any bugs, please send them to
	Josef Spillner, <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>,
or to the mailing list,
	ggz-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.

Have fun!
	- The GGZ Gaming Zone Development Team
