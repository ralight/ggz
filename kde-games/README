======================================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - KDE Game Modules - Release 0.0.7
======================================================

We are proud to say that there are now some KDE games available
for the GGZ Gaming Zone. Some of them are just other frontends
for existing games, others are completely new ones.

Content of GGZ-KDE-Games:
	- KReversi:
		A two-player game which is compatible with its Gtk+ brother.
	- Krosswater:
		KDE port of the Java game "Cross the Water". For two - four
		players.
	- KDots:
		Connect the Dots for KDE. Compatible with the Gtk+ version.
	- KTicTacTux:
		TicTacToe game which is compatible with the Gtk+ version but has
		pictures instead of symbols. Can also run in stand-alone mode where
		it has some extra functionality.
	- Koenig:
		A chess game client, which is on par with the Gtk+ equivalent.
	- Muehle:
		Implements the good old Muehle (Nine men's morris) game.
		Can also be run standalone.
	- Keepalive:
		An experimental game client which implements some newer features.
		May or may not work for you.
	- Fyrdman:
		Colourful client for the Hastings1066 game.
		Works also in standalone mode.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
