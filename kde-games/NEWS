Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.4!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players (at
least it will someday!)

This release of GGZ brings several exciting new features:

- A new ggzcore library to handle core client services, independent of
  frontend 
- A KDE client!
- A limited text/console client
- A rewritten Gtk+ client
- The first public release of the easysock library
- Several new games, including chess, reversi, and more
- Many, many bugfixes
- New packaging scheme, split out based on frontend

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started.
