Installation of GGZ-Games-SDL
=============================

1. Prerequisites are the SDL library (version 1.2 or above),
   and a working OpenGL setup (Mesa or equivalents).
   For geekgame, SDL_image and SDL_ttf are needed too
   (compilation will be disabled otherwise).

2. Type ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if not building from
   the CVS sources), make and make install (as root).

3. Have fun :)

4. Use the file README.GGZ in case there is any trouble,
   and for additional information.
