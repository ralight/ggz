======================================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - SDL Game Modules - Release 0.0.7
======================================================

GGZ does not only feature Gtk+ and KDE games, but also
games written with the SDL toolkit.
The following games are included so far:

	- TicTacToe 3D
		An OpenGL client compatible to our other TicTacToe clients,
		and working fine with our server.
	- The Geek Game
		Calculate numbers, in either direction: horizontally or
		vertically, forwards or backwards, and wrapped around the edges.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
The file README.GGZ does give you additional information.

Have a look at QuickStart.GGZ to learn about the installation process.

If you encounter any bugs, please send them to
	Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>,
or to the mailing list,
	<ggz-dev@lists.sourceforge.net>.

Have fun!
