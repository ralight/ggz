game modes
----------
-> server greeting determines capabilities
-> client lets host player select one

e.g "geekgame" -> modes "easy", "matrix", "havoc", "hax0r"
easy -> achieve a sum of zero either horizontally or vertically
 (range: 0 to 20)
matrix -> sum of row and column (multiplied by 2) must be 42
 (range: 0 to 60)
havoc -> numbers under cursor are binary coded, quotient must be 4
 (range: 4 to 128)
hax0r -> numbers under cursor bars must contain same number of 1's
 (range: 0 to 7)

-> this ensures backward compatibility
-> for each achieved goal, a player gets one level point,
   while the others loose one (down to zero)
-> game ends when one player has 10 level points
