Every internal module (those which are written in C) can now access a common
database for player lookups. Hopefully, there'll be a Perl module too.
To increase efficiency, this information is held in memory for up to let's say
1000 players, and saved using a write-back caching mechanism when committing.

The structure contains the following components:

name -> name of the player, and primary lookup key
status -> either one of STATUS_GUEST, STATUS_REGISTERED, STATUS_ADMIN, STATUS_OWNER
firstseen -> date when this player first appeared on the server
lastseen -> date when he was seen the last time, or now() if he's still in the room
lastactive -> last date when the player has invoked a grubby action
realname -> real name of the player
language -> ISO language code of where the player comes from
publicinfo -> long optional string describing everything about a player which he wants

The database is held as a simple ggzcore_confio text file, and compatible with
the old grubby.rc.
