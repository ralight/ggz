Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.9!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players
(quite a few game support statistics now).
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking.

Features in this release:

- Advanced player rankings and statistics
- Tournaments and game match information in the web interface
- Detail information about people in the individual gaming rooms
- More python programs: a core client, a Chinese Chess game, a Go wrapper
- Chatbot enhancements such as Chess support

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with the
GGZ client.
