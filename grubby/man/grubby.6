grubby \- very intelligent GGZ chat bot
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Grubby is a modular chat bot, which means this program behaves like a human.
Once logged into a GGZ server, you can tell it some news it shall tell
others, and in return it tells you what it has heard of lately.
Additionally, if you say a bad word, it complains about it.
You can even rename grubby to what you want. Common names are
Highlander and Keeper, but you can invent your own ones.
More functionality can be added by plugging in shared libraries, perl scripts,
ruby gems, and whatnot.

Grubby accepts both public commands and owner commands. Please view the
appropriate documentation in the ggz-docs module.
