.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
In order to run the GGZ chat bot (grubby), it must be configured properly.
The grubby-config script saves a lot of work: it does interactively query all
possible options from the user, and build up a working configuration file.
.LP
This script should be run as the user under whose user id grubby will run (this
can be a normal user, or games). It will then ask questions, most of them provide
a default answer. Only the name and the owner is necessary information.
.SH "FILES"
.LP
~/.ggz/grubby.rc - grubby's main configuration file.
