New TODO items:
---------------
* coloured readline prompt using escape sequences
* ggzcomm-generated network layer for TTTXT
* i18n in TTTXT, requires some good magic for the escape sequences
* more text games once it works correctly?

Todo for 0.0.6:
---------------
(maybe) profile list (similar to ncftp)
(maybe) catch up with features (e.g. show extended player list)
(maybe) support for text mode games? e.g. snake or slspades
