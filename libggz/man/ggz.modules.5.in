ggz.modules \- GGZ Gaming Zone module configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The GGZ Gaming Zone uses the file \fIggz.modules\fR
in order to configure which game modules are properly
installed.  The only approved method of altering this
file is using the \fIggz\-config\fP utility, however
the file structure is documented here in order to
facilitate manual repairs if necessary.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.LP 
The \fIggz.modules\fR file is formattted in sections,
each of which begins with a \fI[SectionID]\fP line.  The
first (required) section is \fI[Games]\fP.  This section
is followed by any number of game\-specific sections named
\fI[g#]\fP.
.LP 
The \fI[Games]\fP section is formatted as follows:
.LP 
[Games]
.br 
\fB*GameList*\fR = GameName1 GameName2 ...
.br 
\fBGameName1\fR = g1 g2 ...
.br 
\fBGameName2\fR = g3 ...
.TP 
\fB*GameList*\fR
Should be set to a list of all the game names which are
currently installed.  Each name should appear once and only
once, and should be the internal game name (eg: 
\fINetSpades\fP) and not the full descriptive name of
the game.
.TP 
\fBGameNameX\fR
Should equal a game name from the \fI*GameList*\fP, a real
world example would be \fINetSpades\fP.  It should be
set to a list of unique game section ID's of the form
\fIg#\fP.  Each game section ID must be the name of a
section ID which follows in the file.  The ID's need not
be in any specific order, and ID numbers may be skipped but
NOT repeated.

.LP 
A game section is formatted as follows:
.LP 
\fB[g#]\fR
.br 
Author = Game's Author
.br 
CommandLine = /path/to/command [optionlist]
.br 
Frontend = \fBFECODE\fR
.br 
Homepage = URL to Game's homepage
.br 
Name = \fBGameName\fR
.br 
Protocol = \fBProtocolVersion\fR
.br 
Version = \fBGameVersion\fR
.LP 
Most of these parameters are self explanatory, however
the following may need clarification:
.TP 
\fB[g#]\fR
This section code ID must be present in one of the game
lists in the \fI[Games]\fP section above.
.TP 
\fBFECODE\fR
The frontend code should be set to either \fIgtk\fP or
\fIkde\fP depending on which user interface the game
was designed for.  Note that the game is expected to work
with either the GTK+ or KDE clients, assuming that the
user has the proper windowing system installed.
.TP 
\fBGameName\fR
This must equal the game name (in the \fI[Games]\fP
section) which properly points to this \fI[g#]\fP
section.
.TP 
\fBProtocolVersion\fR
This will be used to match an installed game client with
the protocol version currently used by the game server.
This allows a new game client to be installed, while
retaining the old client for backwards compatibility
with older servers.
.TP 
\fBGameVersion\fR
This is simply the version of the game client itself.
It need not be the same version as the game server as long
as the \fIProtocolVersion\fP ID matches.
