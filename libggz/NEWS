** Intermediate snapshot release of base GGZ Gaming Zone components
** Version 0.99.1 - targeted at developers only - API+ABI breakage included
** Please follow the GGZ 0.0.14 branch to get a complete and stable version

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players,
and even review past games.
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking,
and includes a karma and matchmaking system, and a GGZ applet to play
some games directly in the browser.
GGZ support can be added to existing multiplayer games easily.

We're very pleased that a number of game projects have already
chosen GGZ as their internet gaming platform. Let's work hard to
bring as many multiplayer features into as many games as possible!

** The snapshot release only comprises libggz, ggz-server, ggz-client-libs
** and ggz-txt-client. The next snapshot will include more components
** especially for development not just in C but also in C++, Python and Ruby.
** You can already find them in our SVN.
