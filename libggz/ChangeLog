	  It will bail out if the version (currently that of libggz) is too 
	  old.
	  Since it needs the headers, it should only be called after 
	  AC_GGZ_LIBGGZ.
	  This macro is very useful for external games.

	* tests/tls.c:
	  - sleep 5 seconds instead of just 1
	  Actually this is bad and the TLS handshake code should be improved 
	  to not

	  a while.


2005-05-28 08:15:25  Rev 7252   josef

	* m4/ggz.m4:
	  - another change from freelords: honour prefix for ggz-config
	  Now the following happens: If a game is installed into a prefix 
	  different
	  from the one of GGZ (say GGZ is in /usr/local and the game goes to 
	  $HOME),
	  then while all GGZ data files are copied, no GGZ-related tools are 
	  run.
	  They wouldn't have any effect anyway... neither GGZ integration 
	  nor desktop
	  integration can be achieved by using a different prefix, even 
	  though some
	  desktops can be configured to look up this extra directories, but 
	  this is
	  not yet possible with GGZ and also would unnecessarily complicate 
	  it at
	  this point of time.
	  Josef


2005-05-25 21:17:08  Rev 7251   josef

	* m4/ggz.m4:
	  - first small fix: AC_GGZ_INIT is a public macro, not a private one
	  - second small fix: in ignore mode, substitute ggz dirs correctly
	  Still AM_CONDITIONAL() should be used for all GGZ data handling, 
	  whereas
	  #ifdef WITH_GGZ should be used in the source code.

	* configure.ac src/security/ggz_tls_gnutls.c 
	  src/security/ggz_tls_none.c src/easysock.c 
	  src/security/ggz_tls_openssl.c:
	  Recent changes to easysock do not appear to be supported under 
	  winsock on Win32. This means winsock2 must be used. This update 
	  changes libggz to use winsock2.
	  easysock.c includes an extra header file, ws2tcpip.h, which I have 
	  not checked for in configure.ac on the reasoning that it is part 
	  of the winsock2 package and so HAVE_WINSOCK2_H should imply 
	  ws2tcpip.h exists as well. Shout at me for this if you want.
	  easysock.c makes use of the gai_strerror() function which is not 
	  implemented in current mingw builds. See bug 1188891 at mingw or 
	  this url: https://sourceforge.
	  net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=102435&aid=1188891&group_id=2435 It 
	  has been fixed in CVS so should appear in a release soon hopefully.


2005-04-24 16:31:37  Rev 7152   josef

	* m4/ggz.m4:
	  - typo: ggzdconfdir, not ggzconfdir!


2005-04-15 17:54:31  Rev 7107   jdorje

	* src/ggz_common.c src/ggz_common.h:
	  Preliminary abandoned-seats patch.
	  In principle when a player leaves a running game, his seat becomes
	  abandoned.  He may later rejoin and reclaim his seat, or after a 
	  while
	  he may be given a forfeit.  For the most part this should be 
	  controlled
	  by the game or by ggzd according to the game's options.
	  This patch introduces the preliminary changes for this.  A new 
	  seat type
	  GGZ_SEAT_ABANDONED is added, and basic changes are made to support 
	  it.
	  What is missing is ggzd and ggzdmod support for toggling between 
	  player,
	  abandoned, and open seats.  There's also no forfeit mechanism yet 
	  (although
	  the game may do this by hand if desired).
	  This patch came from the playground; see patches/abandoned.diff 
	  for its
	  history.


2005-04-10 00:13:46  Rev 7100   josef

	* m4/ggz.m4:

	  there


2005-04-03 17:24:02  Rev 7078   josef

	* src/easysock.c:
	  - Support for IPv6
	  This is riq's old patch (4 years! oh my!) with some slight changes 
	  to make
	  it work, including static methods so we don't have to bump the 
	  interface.
	  Since ggzcommunity.org is accessible via IPv6, and it works, this 
	  should
	  be made available to all users.
	  Of course, IP ban protection in ggzd (from clients using IPv6) is a
	  different matter.


2005-03-11 07:11:26  Rev 6978   jdorje

2005-01-24 01:39:48  Rev 6866   jdorje

	* m4/ggz.m4:
	  Change the way channels are created at the client side.  The GGZ 
	  client
	  does not create the channel.  Instead the channel connection data 
	  is sent
	  to the game which makes the connection itself.  This means ggzmod 
	  needs
	  to call the channel-creation function from within ggzcore, adding 
	  a new
	  library dependency.  This is solved by linking ggzcore in along with
	  ggzmod inside AC_GGZ_GGZMOD.

	  - Don't use AC_FUNC_MALLOC, since we don't support it.  See comment.
	  - Add lots of preprocessor checks to test/tls.c:

	  Allow libggz to compile and be used on systems that don't have 
	  syslog.h
	  A configure-time check is done for syslog.h.  If present, we just 
	  #include
	  it.  If it's not present, an enumeration containing the log types is
	  declared.  This must be done at configure-time so that the installed
	  ggz.h file can be entirely self-contained: we can't rely on the 
	  library
	  user following "good" autoconf practices.

	* src/memory.c configure.ac:
	  Add a new compile directive --disable-threading.  If given, this 
	  will
	  remove threading (pthread) support from GGZ.  This means the

	  be thread-safe and should not be used in ggzd.

	  It didn't change now, but from 0.0.6 to 0.0.7 new functions were 
	  added,
	  without increasing the 'current' part of the interface version.
	  To increase compatibility with older GGZs, it is bumped now.

	* ChangeLog:
	  - update changelog


2003-05-13 20:06:31  Rev 5581   dr_maux

	* autogen.sh:
	  - fix sed incompatibility: a-zA-z becomes A-Za-z now
	  - also, if a program is not found, return immediately
	  This has been tested on:
	   * Debian GNU/Linux "sid", sed 4.0.7
	   * Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 "woody", sed 3.0.2
	   * Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "potato", sed 3.0.2
	   * RedHat 7.3 "valhalla", sed 3.0.2
	   * RedHat 7.2 "enigma", sed 3.0.2
	   * Darwin 6.5, sed 4.0.5
	  So it should work :)
	  Note that libtool still isn't found on Darwin, but there's no 
	  --version either,
	  so people who want to use it as their primary development platform 
	  must fix
	  this.
	  Also, the 3rd part makes trouble on Solaris, but then again the 
	  current setup
	  will not very likely build there anyway.


2003-05-11 09:08:52  Rev 5565   dr_maux

	* autogen.sh:
	  - another small update to autogen.sh. Fix autoconf 2.5 -> autoconf 
	  2.50
	    (otherwise it would think 2.13 is enough).
	  - lower the restrictions for libtool and gettext, to be more 
	  friendly to
	    existing distributions.

	* src/ggz.h src/easysock.c:
	  - distinguish between host lookup failures and connection failures 
	  in

2003-02-26 13:39:35  Rev 5459   dr_maux

	* autogen.sh:
	  Some improvements to autogen.sh:
	  - cut away appended revision letters from version numbers (such as 
	  libtool
	    1.4.2a)
	  - run libtoolize if AM_PROG_LIBTOOL is found somewhere in 
	  configure.ac with
	    either none or a bit of whitespace in front of it
	  - shut up libtoolize debug messages
	  Should work even better now.


2003-02-16 18:39:59  Rev 5423   dr_maux

	* src/security/base64.c:

	    ggz_common.
	  - Change existing code to use the above two instead of their own 
	  custom
	    code.
	  - Don't accept invalid and dangerous chat messages (sent across the
	    network).  But do accept invalid and non-dangerous chat messages:
	  to
	    improve backward-compatability if new chat types are added.


2002-10-08 03:29:33  Rev 4810   jdorje

	* Doxyfile:
	  Change the PROJECT_NUMBER to 0.0.6.


2002-10-08 00:11:33  Rev 4808   jdorje

	* libggz.spec:
	  Put doc files in alphabetical order.


2002-10-08 00:08:24  Rev 4807   jdorje

	* libggz.spec:
	  Update .spec file for libggz.
	  This is hard to test, since nobody uses an RPM-based distro...


2002-10-07 21:28:18  Rev 4795   jdorje

	* NEWS:
	  Rewrote NEWS for 0.0.6, and propogated it to all modules.


2002-10-07 21:16:10  Rev 4794   dr_maux

	* ChangeLog:
	  - update changelog for 0.0.6


2002-10-01 15:55:17  Rev 4781   jdorje

	* man/Makefile.am configure.in man/.cvsignore Makefile.am man/ggz.h.
	  3 man:
	  Added man page for libggz.
	  Unfortunately, the man page does not include the entire 
	  documentation.
	  Since ggz.h defines different Doxygen "groups", these are put into 
	  their
	  own manual pages (list.3, easysock.3, etc.), which are currently not
	  included (because who would know to look for them?).  A better 
	  solution is
	  needed.


2002-09-29 13:08:19  Rev 4767   dr_maux

	* src/Makefile.am configure.in:
	  - don't touch LIBOBJS or LTLIBOBJS - autoconf 2.50 doesn't like it 
	  anyway


2002-09-29 12:43:03  Rev 4766   dr_maux

	* configure.in:
	  - libggz goes 0.0.6


2002-09-27 15:42:09  Rev 4750   dr_maux

	* src/Makefile.am:
	  - increase libggz interface version number
	  In libggz's case this is questionable, because only one function 
	  really
	  changed.
	  But there were some obscure macro changes as well. Instead of 
	  writing wrapper
	  functions, we better chose the safe way.
	  This is also a candidate which I expect to become stable.


2002-09-27 08:58:31  Rev 4746   dr_maux

	* autogen.sh:
	  - new autogen


2002-09-25 19:17:21  Rev 4701   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/conf.c:
	  Fix a bug in libggz: interface documentation for 
	  ggz_conf_read_list was
	  wrong.
	  When ggz_conf_read_list is called and no list is present, don't 
	  allocate
	  space for an empty, NULL-terminated list of strings.  Instead just 
	  set
	  the list to NULL.  The interface ducumentation is changed to match.


2002-09-24 07:36:20  Rev 4679   dr_maux

	* QuickStart.GGZ README.GGZ:
	  - update intro docs


2002-09-22 14:56:50  Rev 4651   jdorje

	* src/msg.c:
	  Disable the fork-and-abort feature of ggz_error_msg and 
	  ggz_error_sys.


2002-09-22 14:50:45  Rev 4650   dr_maux

	* src/ggz.h:
	  - commit fix for FUNCTION macro in c++ apps


2002-09-18 18:55:10  Rev 4624   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  Add attributes to ggz_error_msg_exit and ggz_error_sys_exit 
	  marking them
	  as noreturn.


2002-09-18 18:50:40  Rev 4623   jdorje

	* src/misc.h src/msg.c:
	  Declare _ggz_debug only when DEBUG is defined.  This prevents an
	  unused-variable warning (spurious) and also makes compiled code more
	  streamlined.


2002-09-18 18:41:06  Rev 4622   jdorje

	* src/easysock.c:
	  Cast the "status" variable (an integer) to (unsigned) in several 
	  places,
	  just to avoid a spurious warning (status was previously checked to 
	  see if
	  it was negative).


2002-09-18 18:40:05  Rev 4621   jdorje

	* src/misc.c:
	  s/int/size_t/ in two places.


2002-09-17 18:11:43  Rev 4607   jdorje

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  Remove the now-unused GGZ_CHAT_M_MESSAGE and GGZ_CHAT_M_PLAYER.


2002-09-17 02:32:26  Rev 4596   jdorje

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	  Added the strcmp program to TESTS.


2002-09-13 17:19:22  Rev 4550   jdorje

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  Added E_OK to the GGZClientReqError enumeration.  This allows more
	  explicit use of the enumeration.


2002-09-13 16:11:40  Rev 4547   jdorje

	* tests/ggzcommon.c src/numberlist.c:
	  Let numberlists be empty or use arbitrary whitespace.


2002-09-13 15:43:04  Rev 4545   jdorje

	* src/msg.c:
	  To help in debugging: ggz_error_msg_exit and ggz_error_sys_exit 
	  abort(),
	  instead of just exiting.  ggz_error_msg and ggz_error_sys fork and 
	  abort,
	  to leave core while the original process continues.
	  If core is disabled "ulimit -c 0", no core will be left and the 
	  behavior
	  will be virtually unchanged (at least on my platform).
	  Eventually something slightly more complicated may be better: we can
	  attach the core to gdb (if it exists) and mail a backtrace to 
	  ggz-dev.
	  THere's probably some tool out there for automating this.


2002-09-11 03:37:21  Rev 4507   jdorje

	* tests/ggzcommon.c src/ggz_common.h src/numberlist.c:
	  Added a function to return the max of a numberlist.


2002-09-11 03:25:20  Rev 4506   jdorje

	* tests/.cvsignore src/Makefile.am tests tests/ggzcommon.c 
	  src/ggz_common.c tests/Makefile.am src/ggz_common.h src/numberlist.
	  c:
	  Added numberlist code to ggz_common.h, and some boolean conversion
	  helper functions.


2002-08-20 21:12:36  Rev 4377   jdorje

	* tests/debugmsg.c src/msg.c:
	  Fix some (probably harmless) compiler warnings:
	    - msg.c: #if 0...#endif around the unused ggz_debug_debug().
	    - debugmsg.c: debug_suite() is static.


2002-08-07 16:44:11  Rev 4353   jdorje

	* .cvsignore:
	  Change "doc" to "api" to match the doxygen change.


2002-08-07 16:39:13  Rev 4351   jdorje

	* Doxyfile:
	  Updated Doxyfile:
	    - Name: GGZ Gaming Zone -> LibGGZ
	    - Version: (empty) -> 0.0.6pre
	    - Output directory: doc -> api (conforms with other modules)


2002-08-07 16:16:54  Rev 4346   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/msg.c:
	  Add ggz_log() function.  This will be of future use in ggzd.


2002-06-25 20:32:31  Rev 4276   dr_maux

	* configure.in:
	  - solving a digital problem:
	  I fixed a bug after copying the affected lines.
	  I only fixed it in the original.
	  Ergo I have to fix it in the copy too.


2002-06-23 19:50:15  Rev 4275   dr_maux

	* configure.in:
	  - remove unnecessary extra paths from configure.in
	  (hell, why does CVS force me to do a second commit for the 
	  top-level directory...)


2002-06-23 19:49:15  Rev 4274   dr_maux

	* src/ggz.h:
	  - when detecting gcc >= 3 is in use, don't use __FUNCTION__, 
	  because this is
	    incompatible with the latest C standard and will vanish in gcc 3.
	  2 (at least
	    the gcc developers say so)
	    For gcc 2.95 this macro will still be used.
	  - remove unnecessary extra path from configure.in


2002-05-23 20:26:33  Rev 4229   dr_maux

	* configure.in:
	  - check for pthread in libggz already, not only in ggzd
	  This bug fix is proudly presented by the GNU/Hurd which doesn't 
	  have pthread
	  installed by default :-)


2002-05-15 23:30:10  Rev 4205   dr_maux

	* configure.in .cvsignore:
	  - more M4 macro fixes


2002-05-11 16:02:38  Rev 4187   bmh

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  - Remove protocol version since protocol isn't actually implemented
	    here


2002-05-11 06:02:27  Rev 4186   rgade

	* src/ggz.h src/conf.c:
	  - ggz-config --check option written to check/repair a ggz.modules 
	  file
	  - ggz_conf_get_sections() added to retrieve a list of all sections 
	  in a config
	  - ggz_conf_get_keys() added to retrieve a list of all keys in a 
	  config section


2002-05-11 05:43:27  Rev 4185   bmh

	* src/xmlelement.c src/list.c src/ggz_common.c:
	  - Use ggz_strcmp() in several places


2002-05-11 05:20:57  Rev 4184   bmh

	* tests/.cvsignore tests src/misc.c src/ggz.h tests/Makefile.am 
	  tests/strcmp.c:
	  - Added ggz_strcmp() function that accepts NULL strings


2002-05-05 23:47:00  Rev 4171   jdorje

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  Bumped up GGZ_CS_PROTO_VERSION to 7 (from 6).  This should force 
	  people to
	  upgrade their ggzcore, without which things will fail badly for 
	  anyone who
	  tries to launch a game table.
	  Brent wants to move this definition back into ggzcore/ggzd, but 
	  for now
	  I've only bumped it up.


2002-05-03 07:54:20  Rev 4145   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/msg.c:
	  Changed the debug callback handler function to accept a syslog-style
	  priority as well:
	    typedef void (*GGZDebugHandlerFunc)(int priority, const char 
	  *msg);
	  This is the only change to the interface, although some changes to 
	  msg.c
	  were needed as well, of course.  The priority associated with the 
	  message
	  depends on how the message was generated:
	    ggz_debug and _ggz_debug => LOG_DEBUG
	    _ggz_msg => LOG_NOTICE (?)
	    ggz_error_sys and ggz_error_msg => LOG_ERR
	    ggz_error_sys_exit and ggz_error_msg_exit => LOG_CRIT
	  Libggz is not capable of providing nearly all of the features 
	  currently
	  used by ggzd for logging/debugging.  The only thing extra feature 
	  ggzd
	  uses is a separation of "logging" and "debugging" messages.


2002-05-02 17:07:51  Rev 4137   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/msg.c:
	  Added a new typedef, GGZDebugHandlerFunc, to ggz.h, along with a 
	  function
	  to set the debug handler function, ggz_debug_set_func().  Added 
	  code in
	  msg.c to have the debug handler (if present) be called to handle 
	  debugging
	  output instead of writing it to a file/stderr.


2002-05-01 06:35:14  Rev 4128   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/easysock.c:
	  Add the FD of the offending socket to the parameters of the socket 
	  error
	  callback function
	    -typedef void (*ggzIOError) (const char * msg, const GGZIOType 
	  type,
	    +typedef void (*ggzIOError) (const char * msg,
	    +                            const GGZIOType type,
	    +                            const int fd,
	                                 const GGZDataType data);
	  and change the interal code to pass this parameter along with the 
	  others.
	  -1 is passed if there is no applicable FD.
	  I believe no code currently uses this callback except ggzcards 
	  (and that
	  not much, yet), so nothing should be disrupted by this change.  The
	  advantage is that the callee is now able to tell what socket the 
	  problem
	  occurred on, so action can be taken to correct it.  See ggz-dev 
	  for more.


2002-04-27 09:29:40  Rev 4089   dr_maux

	* configure.in:
	  - fix for configure process on 4.5BSD


2002-04-22 19:40:12  Rev 4051   jdorje

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  Moved the list of protocol opcodes out of ggzcore and ggzd and into
	  ggz_common.h in libggz.  This may not be their final resting place,
	  but it
	  is at least an improvement over having duplicated code.


2002-04-13 05:27:40  Rev 3957   bmh

2002-04-06 19:04:18  Rev 3786   dr_maux

	* Makefile.am NEWS README:
	  - include rule to erase config.status during 'make clean'
	    (could this affect anything in a negative way?)
	  - provide simple readme file, and a dummy NEWS (everything which

2002-04-06 18:00:16  Rev 3784   dr_maux

	* tests/Makefile.am:

	  - wel,, make distcheck works now here :)


2002-04-05 22:02:09  Rev 3757   dr_maux

	* QuickStart.GGZ README.GGZ:
	  - add installation instructions and overview to libggz


2002-03-28 20:42:04  Rev 3714   jdorje

	* src/memory.c src/conf.c src/msg.c:
	  Complete the previous change: actually remove msg.h and change 
	  code to
	  match.


2002-03-28 20:33:43  Rev 3713   jdorje

	* src/Makefile.am src/misc.c src/msg.h src/ggz.h tests/read_line.c 
	  src/misc.h:
	  - Move the definition of struct _GGZFile into an internal header 
	  file,
	    so that people won't be tempted to access it directly.
	  - Rename msg.h as misc.h, so that it serves as a global internal 
	  header
	    file (and contains struct _GGZFile).


2002-03-28 20:19:48  Rev 3712   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  More libggz documentation.


2002-03-27 23:08:23  Rev 3696   jdorje

	* Doxyfile:
	  Generate man pages for libggz documentation.


2002-03-26 09:15:10  Rev 3690   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  Comment some more libggz socket functions.


2002-03-26 08:38:01  Rev 3689   jdorje

	* src/conf.c:
	  Slight improvement to ggz_conf_parse() option checking:
	    - Do everything in one if() check.
	    - If there are invalid parameters, log it as an error not just a
	      debugging message.
	  I made these changes because GGZCards client config stuff wasn't 
	  properly
	  working.  Then when I couldn't save the conf.c, I realized that it 
	  was
	  because my partition was entirely full.  But the changes seem good
	  anyway.


2002-03-22 20:46:29  Rev 3619   jdorje

	* src/conf.c:
	  Fixed bug in previous commit.


2002-03-21 19:01:28  Rev 3616   jdorje

	* src/conf.c:
	  Manually null-terminate list in ggz_conf_read_list().


2002-03-02 21:17:21  Rev 3515   bmh

	* src/conf.c:
	  - Fixed ggz_conf_read_list() to always allocate argv even if it's 
	  just
	    a single array consisting of NULL.  that way the caller can always
	    deal with it the same way


2002-02-26 02:57:36  Rev 3474   jdorje

	* acconfig.h configure.in:
	  Change autoconf system so that if DEBUG is not defined 
	  (--enable-debug,
	  currently off by default) we'll get NDEBUG defined instead.


2002-02-25 13:56:14  Rev 3468   jdorje

	* acconfig.h configure.in:
	  Removed --enable-debug-socket and the DEBUG_SOCKET #definition 
	  from the
	  autoconf process.


2002-02-25 13:53:31  Rev 3467   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/easysock.c:
	  - Changed easysock ggz_debug debugging type from "easysock" to 
	  "socket"
	    (well, really GGZ_SOCKET_DEBUG which is "socket").
	  - Added a #definition of GGZ_SOCKET_DEBUG as "socket" to ggz.h, 
	  along
	    with an explanation for doing socket debugging.


2002-02-24 18:40:46  Rev 3454   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/easysock.c:
	  Removed the use of DEBUG_SOCKET, which was only used to control
	  debugging output.  Instead, this debugging output goes through 
	  ggz_debug
	  with type "easysock".  This means the calling program can control 
	  the
	  output no matter how the library was compiled.
	  --enable-debug-socket is still left as a part of the configure 
	  process,
	  and DEBUG_SOCKET is still in acconfig.h.  If there is no other use 
	  for
	  this macro, perhaps it should be removed from these files.
	  I also added information about this to the ggz.h documentation.


2002-02-16 03:04:36  Rev 3367   bmh

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  - Add GGZTableState to common header


2002-02-10 10:38:33  Rev 3299   jdorje

	* src/memory.c src/ggz.h:
	  A few assorted cleanups to libggz/memory:
	    - Changed size parameter of _ggz_malloc and _ggz_realloc from an
	      unsigned int to a size_t (which is what malloc uses).
	    - Added parameter names into the prototypes in ggz.h.
	    - Changed the documentation in ggz.h to use the real parameter 
	  names.
	    - Changed the "tag" parameter from a char* to a const char* in all
	      functions (and the struct).
	  I wonder why it is that the size parameter is a "const" but other 
	  scalar
	  parameters are not?  Is there a reason for this?


2002-02-10 04:35:21  Rev 3293   jdorje

	* src/easysock.c:
	  Changed two uses of vsprintf to vsnprintf, thus avoiding a potential
	  buffer overflow.


2002-02-06 22:38:30  Rev 3263   dr_maux

	* .cvsignore:
	  - put annoying configure-stamp into .cvsignore


2002-02-03 19:19:15  Rev 3227   jdorje

	* src/ggz_common.h:
	  Removed explicit numbering from GGZSeatType enumeration.
	  Note this will break compatibility of most games that implicitly 
	  use the
	  numbering in their communication protocol (this can be dealt with by
	  upping the protocol version numbers, coming shortly).  But it 
	  _does_ make
	  things more readible, and it should be a one-time change, so it's 
	  worth it
	  IMO.


2002-01-24 07:09:51  Rev 3184   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/easysock.c:
	  - Renamed ggz_remove_exit_func as ggz_io_remove_exit_func in 
	  easysock.c
	    (it was already called this in ggz.h).
	  - Added more documentation to ggz.h.


2002-01-23 04:59:24  Rev 3176   jdorje

	* src/easysock.c:
	  Fixed bug in last commit.


2002-01-20 08:36:46  Rev 3159   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h src/easysock.c:
	  Changed ggz_read_string_alloc to allocate memory with ggz_malloc.
	  This will break all code that currently uses this function, but is
	  nonetheless clearly the right thing to do - and should be done 
	  ASAP so
	  the calling code has more time to adjust.  IMO.
	  The internal implementation leaves a bit to be desired.  
	  Previously if
	  the malloc failed we just returned an error, but ggz_malloc will 
	  (I think)
	  exit by default.  This is a bit of a security risk, as a malicious 
	  program
	  at the other end of the socket could send us lots of large strings 
	  and
	  perhaps force us to exit.  OTOH, we do have the alloc_limit so 
	  there is
	  some safety.


2002-01-20 07:48:58  Rev 3158   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  Doxygenated a few easysock function comments.
	  This is pretty tedious stuff, I could only do a few before I got 
	  bored :-).


2002-01-20 03:52:48  Rev 3154   bmh

	* acconfig.h src/Makefile.am configure.in src/strsep.c:
	  - Include replacement strsep function for platforms that don't 
	  have it
	    **cough** Solaris **cough**
	  - Check for strsep function in configure


2002-01-20 03:50:40  Rev 3153   bmh

	* src/easysock.c:
	  - Fixes in ggz_read_fd (the accrights stuff has been messed up for a
	    while now.  How come no one noticed?)


2002-01-19 06:54:16  Rev 3134   bmh

	* Makefile.am:
	  - Added tests to SUBDIRS so the proper files get distributed


2002-01-19 06:53:43  Rev 3133   bmh

	* acconfig.h:
	  - include SUN_LEN, CMSG_ALIGN, CMSG_SPACE, CMSG_LEN macros for
	    platforms that don't have them


2002-01-19 06:17:24  Rev 3132   bmh

	* .cvsignore:
	  - Ignore stamp-h1 file


2002-01-19 05:30:40  Rev 3130   bmh

	* acconfig.h src/Makefile.am src/ggz.h configure.in src/easysock.c:
	  - Absorbed easysock functionality into libggz


2002-01-19 03:21:08  Rev 3129   bmh

	* configure.in:
	  - Use older AM_PROG_LIBTOOL, since not everyone has the latest
	    autoconf/automake yet


2002-01-14 07:04:06  Rev 3113   jdorje

	* src/Makefile.am src/ggz_common.c src/ggz_common.h:
	  Added ggz_common.c, along with a pair of functions from converting a
	  GGZSeatType to and from a string.  They should be of use to any game
	  that uses a text-based protocol and wishes to communicate this 
	  data, or
	  to any program that wants to do debugging output with this data, 
	  or to
	  GGZ itself (which uses the aforementioned text-based protocol).


2002-01-14 05:48:31  Rev 3110   jdorje

	* src/Makefile.am src/ggz_common.h:
	  Moved GGZSeatType definition into libggz.
	  I've created a new file for this, ggz_common.h.  This separates the
	  GGZ-specific code from the support code.


2002-01-12 08:45:51  Rev 3083   jdorje

	* src/misc.c tests/misc.c:
	  Fixed two compiler warnings.


2002-01-12 08:42:57  Rev 3082   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  Fixed small spacing problem.


2002-01-12 08:42:06  Rev 3081   jdorje

	* src/memory.c tests/cfgtest.c src/ggz.h src/conf.c:
	  Changed all internal memory management to use ggz_* functions.
	  This means allocated pointers that are returned should be freed with
	  ggz_free.  Until the user code does this, they will get spurious 
	  memory
	  leak messages.


2002-01-09 13:08:38  Rev 3038   dr_maux

	* src/ggz.h:
	  - here we go again: c++ compatibility


2002-01-08 22:30:47  Rev 3024   bmh

	* tests/cfgtest.c:
	  - Fix conf file tests to use GGZ_ prefixes


2002-01-08 22:29:52  Rev 3023   bmh

	* src/ggz.h src/conf.c:
	  - Use enum for config-file open params, and prefix with GGZ_


2002-01-08 18:20:13  Rev 3015   bmh

	* tests/misc.c:
	  - Correct test to match new behavior of ggz_xml_[un]escape


2002-01-06 21:59:23  Rev 3007   rgade

	* tests/.cvsignore tests tests/read_line.c tests/Makefile.am:
	  Program to test ggz_read_line() feature
	  - Tests lines that span the buffer boundary (left shift required)
	  - Tests lines that occur at end of buffer (read fresh buffer)
	  - Tests lines that cause buffer expansion
	  - Large line lengths test successfully (appx 128KB)


2002-01-06 09:43:56  Rev 3005   rgade

	* src/misc.c src/ggz.h src/conf.c:
	  - Added ggz_free_file_struct() to properly deallocate a GGZFile 
	  structure
	    and it's buffer


2002-01-06 09:28:50  Rev 3004   rgade

	* src/misc.c src/ggz.h src/conf.c:
	  misc.c
	  - ggz_get_file_struct() obtains a struct to use to access 
	  ggz_read_line()
	  - ggz_read_line() reads lines of arbitrary length from an open file
	  conf.c
	  - use ggz_read_line() to read configuration lines with no 1024 
	  char limit
	  ggz.h
	  - comment new functions


2002-01-05 10:23:17  Rev 2999   rgade

	* src/misc.c src/ggz.h:
	  - ggz_(un)escape functions always allocate memory (except on error)
	    to ease end-user coding


2002-01-05 10:11:09  Rev 2998   rgade

	* src/memory.c:
	  - Rewrote _ggz_allocate() so it doesn't require a recursive mutex 
	  but must
	    now be sent an additional parameter which should be SET_LOCK if 
	  a lock is
	    required, or GOT_LOCK if the mutex is already held.


2001-12-18 14:01:31  Rev 2938   bmh

	* .cvsignore:
	  - Added doc dir


2001-12-18 14:00:34  Rev 2937   bmh

	* tests/.cvsignore tests:
	  - Added misc and debug.log


2001-12-18 13:59:42  Rev 2936   bmh

	* configure.in:
	  - Clean and freshen up configure.in


2001-12-18 13:59:05  Rev 2935   bmh

	* src/memory.c:
	  - Remove error message code if src == NULL


2001-12-18 06:56:09  Rev 2930   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  Added the very convenient ggz__attribute macro to libggz:
	    #ifdef __GNUC__
	    #  define ggz__attribute(att)  __attribute__(att)
	    #else
	    #  define ggz__attribute(att)
	    #endif
	  and use it down below:
	    void ggz_debug(const char *type, const char *fmt, ...)
	                   ggz__attribute((format(printf, 2, 3)));
	    /* ...etc... */
	  This macro should be of use to GGZ programs as well.  It needs
	  documentation, though - I'll need to test how Doxygen handles the
	  #ifdef part of the statement.


2001-12-17 22:45:28  Rev 2924   jdorje

	* src/Makefile.am:
	  Added missing source files to the automake list.  Without them,
	  make dist[check] will fail.


2001-12-16 23:26:41  Rev 2900   dr_maux

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	  - use automake's magic to create a test suite
	  - call with 'make check'


2001-12-10 02:49:03  Rev 2844   jdorje

	* src/ggz.h:
	  Added some comments (doxygen-style) to some of the msg routines (the
	  ones I had to look up in msg.c to see what they did :-).


2001-12-10 01:50:49  Rev 2842   jdorje

	* src/memory.c:
	  Finally removed the error message when ggz_strdup is given a NULL
	  pointer.  It will not just happily return NULL in this case.


2001-11-14 02:01:36  Rev 2745   rgade

	* src/memory.c:
	  - Fixed a problem with the recursive mutex algorithm - threads 
	  that waited on
	    the mutex did not follow up by setting themselves as the mutex 
	  owner


2001-11-13 02:27:09  Rev 2729   rgade

	* src/memory.c:
	  - Fixed one of those "it could never occur" bugs with thread locking


2001-11-13 02:04:58  Rev 2727   rgade

	* src/memory.c:
	  - Added locks to critical sections of memory functions


2001-11-11 18:07:25  Rev 2722   rgade

	* src/memory.c:
	  Some sanity checks for memory.c:
	  - Check for NULL tag and replace with <unknown>
	  Best guess behaviors for apps asking for 0 bytes:
	  - Don't store any pointers to 0 length memory buffers, just return 
	  NULL
	    and generate an error
	  - On realloc, if new size is 0 additionally call _ggz_free()


2001-11-10 04:36:08  Rev 2720   bmh

	* tests/debugmsg.correct tests/debug.log.correct:
	  - Added "correct" output of debugmsg so we have something to compare
	    it to


2001-11-10 04:32:36  Rev 2719   bmh

	* src/msg.c:
	  - Don't check for debug_enabled when enabling and disabling types
	    (since this prevents us from setting things up in ggz_debug_init)


2001-11-09 15:52:27  Rev 2712   bmh

	* libggz.txt:
	  - Removed old description of functions (now that we're using 
	  doxygen)


2001-11-09 15:50:34  Rev 2711   bmh

	* tests/debugmsg.c:
	  - Much enhanced testsuite for debugging messages


2001-11-09 15:46:29  Rev 2710   bmh

	* src/memory.c src/msg.h src/ggz.h src/conf.c src/msg.c:
	  - Rethought debugging messages:
	  - New libggz internal function _ggz_debug() only outputs if libggz 
	  was
	    compiled with --enable-debug
	  - Switched all internal messages to use _ggz_debug()
	  - Change exported ggz_debug() to always output so programs linked to
	    libggz can decided for themselves whether or not to use debugging
	  - New internal function _ggz_msg() always outputs
	  - Change ggz_memory_check() to use _ggz_msg()
	  - Change ggz_debug_cleanup() to take an argument, either 
	  GGZ_CHECK_NONE
	    or GGZ_CHECK_MEM (but open for future expansion)
	  - In ggz_debug_cleanup, if GGZ_CHECK_MEM is passed, call
	    ggz_memory_check() *after* freeing internallly using memory, but
	    *before* closing the debug file


2001-11-06 21:25:43  Rev 2682   rgade

	* src/Makefile.am src/misc.c src/ggz.h tests/Makefile.am tests/misc.c:
	  - Added misc.c - contains ggz_xml_escape and ggz_xml_unescape 
	  currently
	  - Wrote test routines for ggz_xml_escape and ggz_xml_unescape


2001-11-04 22:56:41  Rev 2660   bmh

	* src/memory.c:
	  - Change behavior of ggz_relloc to better match libc relloc(): if 
	  you
	    pass in a NULL ptr, it treats it as a call to malloc.  (This was
	    causing a segfault in libggzdmod)


2001-11-04 08:50:08  Rev 2648   rgade

	* src/ggz.h:
	  - Added detailed documentation for ggz_conf routines


2001-11-03 06:33:45  Rev 2633   bmh

	* Doxyfile src/ggz.h:
	  - Add doxygen config file
	  - Add doxygen documentation to ggz.h for memory handling functions

	* tests/.cvsignore tests tests/cfgtest.c src/confio.c src/confio.h 
	  tests/Makefile.am src/conf.c:
	  - Renamed conf_remove_section() to ggz_conf_remove_section()
	  - Wrote configuration test facility
	  - Removed confio* files


2001-10-23 04:31:50  Rev 2596   bmh

	* tests/.cvsignore tests:
	  - Added .cvsignore


2001-10-23 04:30:20  Rev 2595   bmh

	* src/Makefile.am src/conf.c:
	  - Remove (apparently) duplicate confio.*
	  - Rename functions in conf.c to ggz_conf*
	  - Note: this is completely untested and should be checked thoroughly
	    before use


2001-10-23 04:12:02  Rev 2594   bmh

	  cvsignore src/ggz.h src/confio.c src src/conf.c src/msg.c:
	  - Added .cvsignore file
	  - Moved debug/erro message function declarations into ggz.h, 
	  removing
	    '_' prefix
	  - Removed unnecessary msg.h file
	  - Rather than hard code a list of debug types, accept a string as 
	  the
	    debug type
	  - Have debug_init() accept a NULL-terminated array of strings to
	    specify the enabled debugging types
	  - New functions ggz_debug_enable_type() and ggz_debug_disable_type()
	    to turn on/off debugging of specific types
	  - If debug_init() hasn't been called yet, then allow deug messages 
	  to
	    go through
	  - new function ggz_debug_debug() for testing purposed only
