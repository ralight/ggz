2002-10-01 17:55  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, man/.cvsignore, man/Makefile.am,
	man/ggz.h.3: Added man page for libggz.
	
	Unfortunately, the man page does not include the entire
	documentation.	Since ggz.h defines different Doxygen "groups",
	these are put into their own manual pages (list.3, easysock.3,
	etc.), which are currently not included (because who would know to
	look for them?).  A better solution is needed.

2002-09-29 15:08  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, configure.in: - don't touch LIBOBJS or LTLIBOBJS
	- autoconf 2.50 doesn't like it anyway

2002-09-29 14:43  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: - libggz goes 0.0.6

2002-09-27 17:42  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am: - increase libggz interface version number
	
	In libggz's case this is questionable, because only one function
	really changed.  But there were some obscure macro changes as well.
	Instead of writing wrapper functions, we better chose the safe way.
	
	This is also a candidate which I expect to become stable.

2002-09-27 10:56  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh: - new autogen

2002-09-25 21:17  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, ggz.h: Fix a bug in libggz: interface documentation
	for ggz_conf_read_list was wrong.
	
	When ggz_conf_read_list is called and no list is present, don't
	allocate space for an empty, NULL-terminated list of strings. 
	Instead just set the list to NULL.  The interface ducumentation is
	changed to match.

2002-09-24 09:36  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* QuickStart.GGZ, README.GGZ: - update intro docs

2002-09-22 16:56  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/msg.c: Disable the fork-and-abort feature of ggz_error_msg
	and ggz_error_sys.

2002-09-22 16:50  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: - commit fix for FUNCTION macro in c++ apps

2002-09-18 20:55  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: Add attributes to ggz_error_msg_exit and
	ggz_error_sys_exit marking them as noreturn.

2002-09-18 20:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: misc.h, msg.c: Declare _ggz_debug only when DEBUG is
	defined.  This prevents an unused-variable warning (spurious) and
	also makes compiled code more streamlined.

2002-09-18 20:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/easysock.c: Cast the "status" variable (an integer) to
	(unsigned) in several places, just to avoid a spurious warning
	(status was previously checked to see if it was negative).

2002-09-18 20:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/misc.c: s/int/size_t/ in two places.

2002-09-17 20:11  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: Remove the now-unused GGZ_CHAT_M_MESSAGE and
	GGZ_CHAT_M_PLAYER.

2002-09-17 04:32  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Added the strcmp program to TESTS.

2002-09-13 19:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: Added E_OK to the GGZClientReqError
	enumeration.  This allows more explicit use of the enumeration.

2002-09-13 18:11  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/numberlist.c, tests/ggzcommon.c: Let numberlists be empty or
	use arbitrary whitespace.

2002-09-13 17:43  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/msg.c: To help in debugging: ggz_error_msg_exit and
	ggz_error_sys_exit abort(), instead of just exiting.  ggz_error_msg
	and ggz_error_sys fork and abort, to leave core while the original
	process continues.
	
	If core is disabled "ulimit -c 0", no core will be left and the
	behavior will be virtually unchanged (at least on my platform).
	
	Eventually something slightly more complicated may be better: we
	can attach the core to gdb (if it exists) and mail a backtrace to
	ggz-dev.  THere's probably some tool out there for automating this.

2002-09-11 05:37  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h, src/numberlist.c, tests/ggzcommon.c: Added a
	function to return the max of a numberlist.

2002-09-11 05:25  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/ggz_common.c, src/ggz_common.h,
	src/numberlist.c, tests/.cvsignore, tests/Makefile.am,
	tests/ggzcommon.c: Added numberlist code to ggz_common.h, and some
	boolean conversion helper functions.

2002-08-20 23:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/msg.c, tests/debugmsg.c: Fix some (probably harmless)
	compiler warnings:   - msg.c: #if 0...#endif around the unused
	ggz_debug_debug().    - debugmsg.c: debug_suite() is static.

2002-08-07 18:44  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Change "doc" to "api" to match the doxygen change.

2002-08-07 18:39  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Doxyfile: Updated Doxyfile:	- Name: GGZ Gaming Zone -> LibGGZ  
	- Version: (empty) -> 0.0.6pre	 - Output directory: doc -> api
	(conforms with other modules)

2002-08-07 18:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: ggz.h, msg.c: Add ggz_log() function.  This will be of
	future use in ggzd.

2002-06-25 22:32  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: - solving a digital problem: I fixed a bug after
	copying the affected lines.  I only fixed it in the original.  Ergo
	I have to fix it in the copy too.

2002-06-23 21:50  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: - remove unnecessary extra paths from configure.in
	
	(hell, why does CVS force me to do a second commit for the
	top-level directory...)

2002-06-23 21:49  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: - when detecting gcc >= 3 is in use, don't use
	__FUNCTION__, because this is	incompatible with the latest C
	standard and will vanish in gcc 3.2 (at least	the gcc developers
	say so)   For gcc 2.95 this macro will still be used.  - remove
	unnecessary extra path from configure.in

2002-05-23 22:26  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: - check for pthread in libggz already, not only in
	ggzd
	
	This bug fix is proudly presented by the GNU/Hurd which doesn't
	have pthread installed by default :-)

2002-05-16 01:30  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, configure.in: - more M4 macro fixes

2002-05-11 18:02  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: 
	- Remove protocol version since protocol isn't actually implemented
	  here

2002-05-11 08:02  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, ggz.h: - ggz-config --check option written to
	check/repair a ggz.modules file - ggz_conf_get_sections() added to
	retrieve a list of all sections in a config - ggz_conf_get_keys()
	added to retrieve a list of all keys in a config section

2002-05-11 07:43  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: ggz_common.c, list.c, xmlelement.c: 
	- Use ggz_strcmp() in several places

2002-05-11 07:20  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h, src/misc.c, tests/.cvsignore, tests/Makefile.am,
	tests/strcmp.c: 
	- Added ggz_strcmp() function that accepts NULL strings

2002-05-06 01:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: Bumped up GGZ_CS_PROTO_VERSION to 7 (from 6). 
	This should force people to upgrade their ggzcore, without which
	things will fail badly for anyone who tries to launch a game table.
	
	Brent wants to move this definition back into ggzcore/ggzd, but for
	now I've only bumped it up.

2002-05-03 09:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: ggz.h, msg.c: Changed the debug callback handler function
	to accept a syslog-style priority as well:   typedef void
	(*GGZDebugHandlerFunc)(int priority, const char *msg);
	
	This is the only change to the interface, although some changes to
	msg.c were needed as well, of course.  The priority associated with
	the message depends on how the message was generated:	ggz_debug
	and _ggz_debug => LOG_DEBUG   _ggz_msg => LOG_NOTICE (?)  
	ggz_error_sys and ggz_error_msg => LOG_ERR   ggz_error_sys_exit and
	ggz_error_msg_exit => LOG_CRIT
	
	Libggz is not capable of providing nearly all of the features
	currently used by ggzd for logging/debugging.  The only thing extra
	feature ggzd uses is a separation of "logging" and "debugging"
	messages.

2002-05-02 19:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: ggz.h, msg.c: Added a new typedef, GGZDebugHandlerFunc, to
	ggz.h, along with a function to set the debug handler function,
	ggz_debug_set_func().  Added code in msg.c to have the debug
	handler (if present) be called to handle debugging output instead
	of writing it to a file/stderr.

2002-05-01 08:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: easysock.c, ggz.h: Add the FD of the offending socket to
	the parameters of the socket error callback function
	
	  -typedef void (*ggzIOError) (const char * msg, const GGZIOType
	type,
	  +typedef void (*ggzIOError) (const char * msg,
	  +			       const GGZIOType type,
	  +			       const int fd,
				       const GGZDataType data);
	
	and change the interal code to pass this parameter along with the
	others.  -1 is passed if there is no applicable FD.
	
	I believe no code currently uses this callback except ggzcards (and
	that not much, yet), so nothing should be disrupted by this change.
	 The advantage is that the callee is now able to tell what socket
	the problem occurred on, so action can be taken to correct it.	See
	ggz-dev for more.

2002-04-27 11:29  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: - fix for configure process on 4.5BSD

2002-04-22 21:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: Moved the list of protocol opcodes out of
	ggzcore and ggzd and into ggz_common.h in libggz.  This may not be
	their final resting place, but it is at least an improvement over
	having duplicated code.

2002-04-13 07:27  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: 
	- Updated changelog entries for 0.0.5 release

	* src/ggz.h: 
	- Added documentation for list and stack functions

2002-04-09 15:07  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/: control, rules: - finalize libggz packages

2002-04-07 18:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Add Doxyfile to EXTRA_DIST.

2002-04-07 07:37  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/: .cvsignore, files: - remove generated file 'files' -
	update .cvsignore

2002-04-07 07:36  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/control: [no log message]

2002-04-07 06:26  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/rules: - don't install our ChangeLog into the debian doc
	dir

2002-04-07 06:22  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/control: - replaces old 0.0.4 package easysock to be
	deinstalled

2002-04-06 13:06  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/: .cvsignore, README.Debian, changelog, control,
	copyright, files, libggz-dev.docs, libggz-dev.files, libggz0.docs,
	libggz0.files, rules: - debianize libggz

2002-04-06 13:04  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, NEWS, README: - include rule to erase config.status
	during 'make clean'   (could this affect anything in a negative
	way?) - provide simple readme file, and a dummy NEWS (everything
	which makes the file   larger than 0 bytes counts ;)

2002-04-06 12:00  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am: - create a local 'clean' rule to erase the
	debug.log file - wel,, make distcheck works now here :)

2002-04-05 16:02  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* QuickStart.GGZ, README.GGZ: - add installation instructions and
	overview to libggz

2002-03-28 14:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, memory.c, msg.c: Complete the previous change:
	actually remove msg.h and change code to match.

2002-03-28 14:33  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/ggz.h, src/misc.c, src/misc.h, src/msg.h,
	tests/read_line.c: - Move the definition of struct _GGZFile into an
	internal header file,	so that people won't be tempted to access
	it directly.  - Rename msg.h as misc.h, so that it serves as a
	global internal header	 file (and contains struct _GGZFile).

2002-03-28 14:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: More libggz documentation.

2002-03-27 17:08  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Doxyfile: Generate man pages for libggz documentation.

2002-03-26 03:15  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: Comment some more libggz socket functions.

2002-03-26 02:38  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conf.c: Slight improvement to ggz_conf_parse() option
	checking:   - Do everything in one if() check.	  - If there are
	invalid parameters, log it as an error not just a      debugging
	message.  I made these changes because GGZCards client config stuff
	wasn't properly working.  Then when I couldn't save the conf.c, I
	realized that it was because my partition was entirely full.  But
	the changes seem good anyway.

2002-03-22 14:46  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conf.c: Fixed bug in previous commit.

2002-03-21 13:01  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conf.c: Manually null-terminate list in ggz_conf_read_list().

2002-03-02 15:17  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conf.c: 
	- Fixed ggz_conf_read_list() to always allocate argv even if it's
	just   a single array consisting of NULL.  that way the caller can
	always	 deal with it the same way

2002-02-25 20:57  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Change autoconf system so that if DEBUG
	is not defined (--enable-debug, currently off by default) we'll get
	NDEBUG defined instead.

2002-02-25 07:56  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Removed --enable-debug-socket and the
	DEBUG_SOCKET #definition from the autoconf process.

2002-02-25 07:53  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: easysock.c, ggz.h: - Changed easysock ggz_debug debugging
	type from "easysock" to "socket"   (well, really GGZ_SOCKET_DEBUG
	which is "socket").  - Added a #definition of GGZ_SOCKET_DEBUG as
	"socket" to ggz.h, along   with an explanation for doing socket
	debugging.

2002-02-24 13:48  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.tls, configure.in: - Implement --with-tls[=ARG] -
	defaults to no if not specified, or   auto if no argument - Use
	$LIBSSL for OpenSSL's GGZTLS_LDFLAGS - Added chosen SSL
	implementation to configure's final summary

2002-02-24 12:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: easysock.c, ggz.h: Removed the use of DEBUG_SOCKET, which
	was only used to control debugging output.  Instead, this debugging
	output goes through ggz_debug with type "easysock".  This means the
	calling program can control the output no matter how the library
	was compiled.
	
	--enable-debug-socket is still left as a part of the configure
	process, and DEBUG_SOCKET is still in acconfig.h.  If there is no
	other use for this macro, perhaps it should be removed from these
	files.
	
	I also added information about this to the ggz.h documentation.

2002-02-24 03:26  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, acconfig.h, acinclude.tls, autogen.sh, configure.in,
	src/Makefile.am, src/ggz.h: - Moved tls/ files to src/tls -
	Conditionally compile src/tls/*.c based on which TLS lib to use -
	Create a convenience lib in src/tls - libtls.la - Statically link
	libtls.la into libggz.la - GnuTLS should be working okay - OpenSSL
	definitely needs fixes - none might - Retained old tls/ directory
	(for now) in case I screwed something up bad

2002-02-23 01:34  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.tls: file acinclude.tls was initially added on branch
	tls-branch.

2002-02-23 01:34  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.tls, configure.in: - Initial checkin of tls patches to
	tls-branch

2002-02-15 21:04  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: 
	- Add GGZTableState to common header

2002-02-10 04:38  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: ggz.h, memory.c: A few assorted cleanups to libggz/memory: 
	 - Changed size parameter of _ggz_malloc and _ggz_realloc from an  
	  unsigned int to a size_t (which is what malloc uses).    - Added
	parameter names into the prototypes in ggz.h.	 - Changed the
	documentation in ggz.h to use the real parameter names.    -
	Changed the "tag" parameter from a char* to a const char* in all   
	  functions (and the struct).
	
	I wonder why it is that the size parameter is a "const" but other
	scalar parameters are not?  Is there a reason for this?

2002-02-09 22:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/easysock.c: Changed two uses of vsprintf to vsnprintf, thus
	avoiding a potential buffer overflow.

2002-02-06 16:38  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: - put annoying configure-stamp into .cvsignore

2002-02-03 13:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz_common.h: Removed explicit numbering from GGZSeatType
	enumeration.
	
	Note this will break compatibility of most games that implicitly
	use the numbering in their communication protocol (this can be
	dealt with by upping the protocol version numbers, coming shortly).
	 But it _does_ make things more readible, and it should be a
	one-time change, so it's worth it IMO.

2002-01-24 01:09  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: easysock.c, ggz.h: - Renamed ggz_remove_exit_func as
	ggz_io_remove_exit_func in easysock.c	(it was already called this
	in ggz.h).  - Added more documentation to ggz.h.

	* src/easysock.c: Fixed bug in last commit.

2002-01-20 02:36  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: easysock.c, ggz.h: Changed ggz_read_string_alloc to
	allocate memory with ggz_malloc.
	
	This will break all code that currently uses this function, but is
	nonetheless clearly the right thing to do - and should be done ASAP
	so the calling code has more time to adjust.  IMO.
	
	The internal implementation leaves a bit to be desired.  Previously
	if the malloc failed we just returned an error, but ggz_malloc will
	(I think) exit by default.  This is a bit of a security risk, as a
	malicious program at the other end of the socket could send us lots
	of large strings and perhaps force us to exit.	OTOH, we do have
	the alloc_limit so there is some safety.

2002-01-20 01:48  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: Doxygenated a few easysock function comments.
	
	This is pretty tedious stuff, I could only do a few before I got
	bored :-).

2002-01-19 21:52  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/strsep.c: 
	- Include replacement strsep function for platforms that don't have
	it   **cough** Solaris **cough** - Check for strsep function in
	configure

2002-01-19 21:50  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/easysock.c: 
	- Fixes in ggz_read_fd (the accrights stuff has been messed up for
	a   while now.	How come no one noticed?)

2002-01-19 00:54  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: 
	- Added tests to SUBDIRS so the proper files get distributed

2002-01-19 00:53  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h: 
	- include SUN_LEN, CMSG_ALIGN, CMSG_SPACE, CMSG_LEN macros for	
	platforms that don't have them

2002-01-19 00:17  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: 
	- Ignore stamp-h1 file

2002-01-18 23:30  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/easysock.c,
	src/ggz.h: 
	- Absorbed easysock functionality into libggz

2002-01-18 21:21  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: 
	- Use older AM_PROG_LIBTOOL, since not everyone has the latest	
	autoconf/automake yet

2002-01-14 01:04  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: Makefile.am, ggz_common.c, ggz_common.h: Added
	ggz_common.c, along with a pair of functions from converting a
	GGZSeatType to and from a string.  They should be of use to any
	game that uses a text-based protocol and wishes to communicate this
	data, or to any program that wants to do debugging output with this
	data, or to GGZ itself (which uses the aforementioned text-based
	protocol).

2002-01-13 23:48  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: Makefile.am, ggz_common.h: Moved GGZSeatType definition
	into libggz.
	
	I've created a new file for this, ggz_common.h.  This separates the
	GGZ-specific code from the support code.

2002-01-12 02:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/misc.c, tests/misc.c: Fixed two compiler warnings.

2002-01-12 02:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: Fixed small spacing problem.

2002-01-12 02:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conf.c, src/ggz.h, src/memory.c, tests/cfgtest.c: Changed all
	internal memory management to use ggz_* functions.
	
	This means allocated pointers that are returned should be freed
	with ggz_free.	Until the user code does this, they will get
	spurious memory leak messages.

2002-01-09 07:08  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: - here we go again: c++ compatibility

2002-01-08 16:30  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cfgtest.c: 
	- Fix conf file tests to use GGZ_ prefixes

2002-01-08 16:29  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, ggz.h: 
	- Use enum for config-file open params, and prefix with GGZ_

2002-01-08 12:20  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/misc.c: 
	- Correct test to match new behavior of ggz_xml_[un]escape

2002-01-06 15:59  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am, read_line.c: Program to test
	ggz_read_line() feature - Tests lines that span the buffer boundary
	(left shift required) - Tests lines that occur at end of buffer
	(read fresh buffer) - Tests lines that cause buffer expansion -
	Large line lengths test successfully (appx 128KB)

2002-01-06 03:43  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, ggz.h, misc.c: - Added ggz_free_file_struct() to
	properly deallocate a GGZFile structure   and it's buffer

2002-01-06 03:28  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, ggz.h, misc.c: misc.c - ggz_get_file_struct()
	obtains a struct to use to access ggz_read_line() - ggz_read_line()
	reads lines of arbitrary length from an open file
	
	conf.c - use ggz_read_line() to read configuration lines with no
	1024 char limit
	
	ggz.h - comment new functions

2002-01-05 04:23  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: ggz.h, misc.c: - ggz_(un)escape functions always allocate
	memory (except on error)   to ease end-user coding

2002-01-05 04:11  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: - Rewrote _ggz_allocate() so it doesn't require a
	recursive mutex but must   now be sent an additional parameter
	which should be SET_LOCK if a lock is	required, or GOT_LOCK if
	the mutex is already held.

2001-12-18 08:01  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: 
	- Added doc dir

2001-12-18 08:00  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/.cvsignore: 
	- Added misc and debug.log

2001-12-18 07:59  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: 
	- Clean and freshen up configure.in

2001-12-18 07:59  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: 
	- Remove error message code if src == NULL

2001-12-18 00:56  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: Added the very convenient ggz__attribute macro to
	libggz:
	
	  #ifdef __GNUC__
	  #  define ggz__attribute(att)  __attribute__(att)
	  #else
	  #  define ggz__attribute(att)
	  #endif
	
	and use it down below:
	
	  void ggz_debug(const char *type, const char *fmt, ...)
			 ggz__attribute((format(printf, 2, 3)));
	  /* ...etc... */
	
	This macro should be of use to GGZ programs as well.  It needs
	documentation, though - I'll need to test how Doxygen handles the
	#ifdef part of the statement.

2001-12-17 16:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am: Added missing source files to the automake list.
	 Without them, make dist[check] will fail.

2001-12-16 17:26  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am: - use automake's magic to create a test suite
	- call with 'make check'

2001-12-09 20:49  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: Added some comments (doxygen-style) to some of the msg
	routines (the ones I had to look up in msg.c to see what they did
	:-).

2001-12-09 19:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: Finally removed the error message when ggz_strdup
	is given a NULL pointer.  It will not just happily return NULL in
	this case.

2001-11-13 20:01  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: - Fixed a problem with the recursive mutex
	algorithm - threads that waited on   the mutex did not follow up by
	setting themselves as the mutex owner

2001-11-12 20:27  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: - Fixed one of those "it could never occur" bugs
	with thread locking

2001-11-12 20:04  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: - Added locks to critical sections of memory
	functions

2001-11-11 12:07  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: Some sanity checks for memory.c: - Check for NULL
	tag and replace with <unknown> Best guess behaviors for apps asking
	for 0 bytes: - Don't store any pointers to 0 length memory buffers,
	just return NULL   and generate an error - On realloc, if new size
	is 0 additionally call _ggz_free()

2001-11-09 22:36  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/: debug.log.correct, debugmsg.correct: 
	- Added "correct" output of debugmsg so we have something to
	compare   it to

2001-11-09 22:32  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/msg.c: 
	- Don't check for debug_enabled when enabling and disabling types  
	(since this prevents us from setting things up in ggz_debug_init)

2001-11-09 09:52  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libggz.txt: 
	- Removed old description of functions (now that we're using
	doxygen)

2001-11-09 09:50  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/debugmsg.c: 
	- Much enhanced testsuite for debugging messages

2001-11-09 09:46  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: conf.c, ggz.h, memory.c, msg.c, msg.h: 
	- Rethought debugging messages: - New libggz internal function
	_ggz_debug() only outputs if libggz was   compiled with
	--enable-debug - Switched all internal messages to use _ggz_debug()
	- Change exported ggz_debug() to always output so programs linked
	to   libggz can decided for themselves whether or not to use
	debugging - New internal function _ggz_msg() always outputs -
	Change ggz_memory_check() to use _ggz_msg() - Change
	ggz_debug_cleanup() to take an argument, either GGZ_CHECK_NONE	 or
	GGZ_CHECK_MEM (but open for future expansion) - In
	ggz_debug_cleanup, if GGZ_CHECK_MEM is passed, call  
	ggz_memory_check() *after* freeing internallly using memory, but  
	*before* closing the debug file

2001-11-06 15:25  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/ggz.h, src/misc.c, tests/Makefile.am,
	tests/misc.c: - Added misc.c - contains ggz_xml_escape and
	ggz_xml_unescape currently - Wrote test routines for ggz_xml_escape
	and ggz_xml_unescape

2001-11-04 16:56  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/memory.c: 
	- Change behavior of ggz_relloc to better match libc relloc(): if
	you   pass in a NULL ptr, it treats it as a call to malloc.  (This
	was   causing a segfault in libggzdmod)

2001-11-04 02:50  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ggz.h: - Added detailed documentation for ggz_conf routines

2001-11-03 00:33  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Doxyfile, src/ggz.h: 
	- Add doxygen config file - Add doxygen documentation to ggz.h for
	memory handling functions

2001-10-29 01:11  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conf.c, src/confio.c, src/confio.h, tests/.cvsignore,
	tests/Makefile.am, tests/cfgtest.c: - Renamed conf_remove_section()
	to ggz_conf_remove_section() - Wrote configuration test facility -
	Removed confio* files

2001-10-22 23:31  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/.cvsignore: - Added .cvsignore

2001-10-22 23:30  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: Makefile.am, conf.c: 
	- Remove (apparently) duplicate confio.* - Rename functions in
	conf.c to ggz_conf* - Note: this is completely untested and should
	be checked thoroughly	before use

2001-10-22 23:12  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in, src/ggz.h, src/msg.c, tests/debugmsg.c: [no log
	message]

2001-10-22 23:07  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/: Makefile.am, debugmsg.c: 
	- Added test program for debug/messages

2001-10-22 23:06  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am, conf.c, confio.c, ggz.h, memory.c,
	msg.c, msg.h, xmlelement.c: 
	- Added .cvsignore file - Moved debug/erro message function
	declarations into ggz.h, removing   '_' prefix - Removed
	unnecessary msg.h file - Rather than hard code a list of debug
	types, accept a string as the	debug type - Have debug_init()
	accept a NULL-terminated array of strings to   specify the enabled
	debugging types - New functions ggz_debug_enable_type() and
	ggz_debug_disable_type()   to turn on/off debugging of specific
	types - If debug_init() hasn't been called yet, then allow deug
	messages to   go through - new function ggz_debug_debug() for
	testing purposed only

2001-10-21 19:27  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: 
	- Added .cvsignore file
