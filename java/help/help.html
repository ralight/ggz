<h2><a name="q-1">1.</a> Do I need an account to play?</h2>
<p>No. You can log in as a guest at any time simply by entering a
nickname of your choosing. If the particular nickname that you have
chosen is already taken then you will be informed of this and will have
to choose another.</p>
<h2><a name="q-2">2.</a> How do I register?</h2>
<p>To register as a new user, select the <em>Register new User</em>
option, enter a Nickname that you want users to recognise you by and a
password. You can enter an email address if you like but you aren't
forced to if you prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
<h2><a name="q-3">3.</a> Can I play if I'm behind a firewall?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately you won't be able to play from behind a firewall unless
your adminstrator has enabled traffic on port 5688.</p>
<h2><a name="q-4">4.</a> How can I change the font?</h2>
<p>You can change the chat font by clicking the <em>Preferences...</em>
link at the bottom of the window. You can't change the font for other
items like the player or room lists. However, the web site administrator
can change the font for all users so if you find it hard to read to try
sending him or her an email to see if it can be changed. All the colours
are also configurable on a site by site basis. If you want this same
control you can download the application version and edit a
configuration file, the details of which are currently secret...</p>
<h2><a name="q-5">5.</a> Where do I go for help?</h2>
<p>The software was written by people in their spare time as part of the
<a href="http://ggzgamingzone.org/">GGZ Gaming Zone project</a> .
However if you are not currently on the GGZ site it is likely that you
are playing on a server hosted by someone else who has created a
separate online gaming community. It's usually best to contact the web
site where you found this first.</p>
<h2><a name="q-6">6.</a>How do I get rid of the bearded fella?</h2>
<p>You can't. GGZ doesn't currently support avatars and this guy is just
there to let you know that you are playing against a human rather than a
computer. We're currently working on a better icon for this.</p>
<h2><a name="q-7">7.</a> The <em>How to play</em> link doesn't work</h2>
<p>This is most likely because you are using a popup blocker. Some popup
blockers allow you to hold down the <em>CTRL</em> key when you click on
a link to temporarily bypass the popup blocker. If this does not work
then you may need to disable the popup blocker for this site. However,
you should log off first since the applet is likely to be reloaded by
the browser when you do this.</p>
<h2><a name="q-8">8.</a>How do I send a private message?</h2>
<p>Select a player in the player list and click the <img
    src="private_chat.png" alt="Private message" /> button.</p>
<p>If you are feeling adventurous, you can also type <b>/msg nickname
some message</b> in the chat field. Once the recipient replies a window
will open that allows you to have a private conversation that noone else
can see.</p>
<p>If you just want to get someone's attention you can type <b>/beep
nickname</b> to make their computer beep. You can also do this with the
mouse by selecting a player and clicking the <img src="beep.png"
    alt="Beep" /> button.</p>
<h2><a name="q-9">9.</a>How do I host or create a table?</h2>
<p>Just click the <em>New Game</em> button above the chat area. A window
will appear that lets you create a table on which you can either play
alone against the computer or with others. If you reserve seats, then
only those players that you reserve seats for will be able to join. When
you click <em>OK</em> the table will be created.</p>
<h2><a name="q-10">10.</a>Someone said something about opening the Java
Console, eh?</h2>
<p>You probably got booted from the table or something else undesirable,
right? OK, here's how you open the console.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Look for the Java coffee cup in your system tray. It looks like
    this <img src="javasystemtrayicon.png" alt="Java System Tray Icon" /></li>
    <li>Right click on it and you should get a popup menu. Select <em>Open
    Console</em>.<br />
    <img src="javapopupmenu.png" alt="Java Popup Menu" /></li>
    <li>A window will appear with loads of text in it, click <em>Copy</em>.</li>
    <li>Open an email and paste into it.</li>
    <li>Address the email to <a href="mailto:helg@ggzgamingzone.org">helg@ggzgamingzone.org</a>
    and send it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will help us track down the source of the error and fix it.</p>
<h2><a name="q-11">11.</a>Things are screwed up, now what?</h2>
<p>The best thing to do is to shut down your browser and then start
again. You don't need to restart your computer but you do need to make
sure that the Java coffee cup disappears from the system tray (the icon
that you right-clicked on to open the console). When there are no Java
icons left then you know that you've shut it all down and can then open
your browser again.</p>
<h2><a name="q-12">12.</a>The chat doesn't always scroll by itself.</h2>
<p>This is done on purpose so that you can scroll up to read the chat
history. When the scroll bar is not right at the bottom, the chat area
doesn't automatically scroll. If you want it to start scrolling again,
just move the slider all the way to the bottom again.</p>
<h2><a name="q-13">13.</a>What "smiley's" are supported?</h2>
<p>More formally known as <em>emoticons</em>, these are the ones that
GGZ understands.</p>
