<h2><a name="q-1">1.</a> Do I need an account to play?</h2>
No. You can log in as a guest at any time simply by entering a nickname
of your choosing. If the particular nickname that you have chosen is
already taken then you will be informed of this and will have to choose
another.
<h2><a name="q-2">2.</a> How do I register?</h2>
To register as a new user, select the
<em>New User</em>
option, enter a Nickname that you want users to recognise you by and a
password. You can enter an email address if you like but you aren't
forced to if you prefer to remain totally anonymous.
<h2><a name="q-3">3.</a> Can I play if I'm behind a firewall?</h2>
Unfortunately you won't be able to play from behind a firewall unless
your adminstrator has enabled traffic on port 5688.
<h2><a name="q-4">4.</a> How can I change the font?</h2>
You can't. However, the web site administrator can change the font for
all users so if you find it hard to read to try sending him or her an
email to see if it can be changed. All the colours are also configurable
on a site by site basis.
<h2><a name="q-5">5.</a> Where do I go for help?</h2>
The software was written by people in their spare time as part of the
<a href="http://ggzgamingzone.org/">GGZ Gaming Zone project</a>
. However if you are not currently on the GGZ site it is likely that you
are playing on a server hosted by someone else who has created a
separate online gaming community. It's usually best to contact the web
site where you found this first.
<h2><a name="q-6">6.</a>How do I get rid of the bearded fella?</h2>
You can't. GGZ doesn't currently support user customisable avatars but if you 
don't like the little bearded men feel free to send an email to 
helg@ggzgamingzone.org with new ones. The sizes are 16x16 and 32x32 GIFs.
<h2><a name="q-7">7.</a> The <em>How to play</em> link doesn't work</h2>
This is most likely because you are using a popup blocker. Some popup
blockers allow you to hold down the
<em>CTRL</em>
key when you click on a link to temporarily bypass the popup blocker. If
this does not work then you may need to disable the popup blocker for
this site. However, you should log off first since the applet is likely
to be reloaded by the browser when you do this.
<h2><a name="q-8">8.</a>How do I send a private message?</h2>
Type <b>/msg nickname some message</b> in the chat field. Once they reply a
window will open that allows you to have a private conversation that noone else
can see. If you just want to get somone's attention you can type <b>/beep 
nickname</b> to make their computer beep.
