<h2><a name="1"/>Do I need an account to play?</h2>
No. You can log in as a guest at any time simply by entering a nickname
of your choosing. If the particular nickname that you have chosen is
already taken then you will be informed of this and will have to choose
another.
<h2><a name="2"/>How do I register?</h2>
To register as a new user, select the
<em>New User</em>
option, enter a Nickname that you want users to recognise you by and a
password. You can enter an email address if you like but you aren't
forced to if you prefer to remain totally anonymous.
<h2><a name="3"/>Can I play if I'm behind a firewall?</h2>
Unfortunately you won't be able to play from behind a firewall unless
your adminstrator has enabled traffic on port 5688.
<h2><a name="4"/>How can I change the font?</h2>
You can't. However, the web site administrator can change the font for
all users so if you find it hard to read to try sending him or her an
email to see if it can be changed. All the colours are also configurable
on a site by site basis.
<h2><a name="5"/>Where do I go for help?</h2>
The software was written by people in their spare time as part of the
<a href="http://ggzgamingzone.org/">GGZ Gaming Zone project</a>
. However if you are not currently on the GGZ site it is likely that you
are playing on a server hosted by someone else who has created a
separate online gaming community. It's usually best to contact the web site
where you found this first.
