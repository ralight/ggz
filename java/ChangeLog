	* :
	  - ignore 'bin' directory


2006-03-07 13:26:19  Rev 7895   josef

	* :
	  - move GGZ-Java to a module on its own


2006-03-07 02:06:13  Rev 7886   helg

	* :
	  Fixed bug in Bridge where bidding UI was not being removed once 
	  play started.


2006-03-03 00:52:00  Rev 7882   helg

	* :
	  


2006-02-15 00:58:07  Rev 7871   helg

	* :
	  Improved default browser detection under Unix when clicking on a 
	  hyperlink (e.g. How to play) when running as an app. It's still 
	  not very good but it's better than it was.


2006-02-15 00:16:01  Rev 7870   helg

	* :
	  Made wholesale changes to enum classes to provide compatibility 
	  with JDK1.4. Also removed generic collections for the same reason. 
	  Added custom bid panel for Bridge so that you can more easily see 
	  the other players bids and rather than having a large array of 
	  buttons you now have specialised buttons just for bridge.

2006-02-10 12:56:12  Rev 7854   josef

	* :
	  - brazilian portuguese translation for the applet UI


2006-02-10 10:24:50  Rev 7852   josef

	* :
	  - some corrections to the German translation


2006-02-10 06:19:08  Rev 7851   helg

	* :
	  More localisation. Does it never end?


2006-02-10 02:05:12  Rev 7850   helg

	* :
	  Changed the way Server XML is traced (yet again). Server XML is 
	  not traced byte for byte rather than after XML parsing.


2006-02-10 01:36:27  Rev 7849   helg

	* :
	  Added i18n support for Net and Server classes.


2006-02-09 09:22:58  Rev 7847   helg

	* :
	  Added i18n support for core client. Current supported languages 
	  are English and German.


2006-02-07 06:23:07  Rev 7843   helg

	* :
	  


2006-02-07 06:20:15  Rev 7842   helg

	* :
	  Added "bad username" result code.
	  Renamed CardSeat to Player.


2006-02-07 00:12:48  Rev 7841   helg

	* :
	  Modified Net to use SAX Transformer to generate XML instead of 
	  concatenating strings. This guarantees that all XML sent to the 
	  server by the Java client will be well formed.
	  "Back to Lounge" button is not disabled while playing a game.


2006-02-02 08:03:38  Rev 7835   helg

	* :
	  Forgot to update the TODO file.


2006-02-02 07:55:17  Rev 7834   helg

	* :
	  Set socket keep alive to true so that games don't lose socket 
	  connection if user doesn't do anything for a long time. There is 
	  no application level heartbeat for GGZCards so hopefully this 
	  fixes the "connection reset" problem.
	  Added more SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to hopefully resolve some 
	  Swing threading issues.
	  Java clients can now spectate!


2006-01-30 13:51:38  Rev 7833   helg

	* :
	  Minor size and color tweaks.


2006-01-30 12:24:56  Rev 7830   helg

	* :
	  Created new layout for chat and card table.


2006-01-30 09:28:01  Rev 7829   helg

	* :
	  Add tool tip to player list in game rooms that shows player stats. 
	  Improved animation performance for deal and trick win.


2006-01-30 06:48:15  Rev 7828   helg

	* :
	  Added LGPL terms to the top of each source file.


2006-01-30 06:23:49  Rev 7827   helg

	* :
	  Added about box and new watermark. Added open source class that 
	  launches platform browser when clicking game help when running as 
	  application. Made a few other minor adjustments.


2006-01-29 14:08:51  Rev 7826   helg

	* :
	  Add seat allocation dialog. Only thing is it doesn't ley you 
	  allocate seats yet. The main reason I did it was to remove the 
	  "play against computer" button since people were clicking on "new 
	  game" instead and then couldn't work out how to play against the 
	  computer. Seat allocation and named bot support is coming...


2006-01-29 10:49:10  Rev 7825   helg

	* :
	  Removed rose from applet since it doesn't seem appropriate. I 
	  haven't got a replacement at the moment but when I find something 
	  I'll put a watermark back.


2006-01-25 14:16:39  Rev 7822   helg

	* :
	  Added chat icon that I drew myself after some searching in free 
	  icon libraries for inspiration.
