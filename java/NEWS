Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.13!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players,
and even review past games.
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking,
and includes a karma and matchmaking system, and a GGZ applet to play
some games directly in the browser.
GGZ support can be added to existing multiplayer games easily.

Features in this release:

- GGZ for Java: swing-based core client and GGZCards port
- Embedded ggz-gtk for external Gtk+ games (like Freeciv)
- More server options and higher protocol resiliency
- Privileges system and more plugin scripts for Grubby
- More GGZBoard games: Arimaa and ConnectX
- and many more!

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with one
of the GGZ core clients to be able to start playing.
