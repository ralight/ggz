Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.11!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players,
and even review past games.
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking,
and includes a karma and matchmaking system.

Features in this release:

- Reworked kde-client applications and improved desktop integration
- Lots of Spanish translations
- Graphical configurator for the chatbot grubby
- Many ggzcore enhancements like initial password or auto-reconnection
- Games: new game Ludo and single player mode for Koenig
- Support for IPv6, server-side savegames, abandoned seats in the server
- Documentation overhaul with a dozen new documents
- and many more!

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with the
GGZ client.
