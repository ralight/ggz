Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.12!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players,
and even review past games.
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking,
and includes a karma and matchmaking system.
GGZ support can be added to existing multiplayer games easily.

Features in this release:

- Common seat assignments dialog for the KDE games
- SQlite database support for the server
- Templates and internationalization for the GGZ Community web interface
- Build system and compiler compatibility updates
- More savegame handlers, e.g. for Connect the Dots and Freelords
- Consolidated C++ interface for the game server library (ggzdmod++)
- Overhauled package files for Debian
- and many more!

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with one
of the GGZ core clients.
