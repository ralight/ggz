=======================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - GTK+ Game Modules
=======================================

GGZ Gaming Zone GTK+ Game Modules provide the game executables,
graphics, and data for a number of popular (and unique) network games.
These games are coded for version 2.X of GTK+, but many of them are also
available using different graphical interfaces.

This version of the GTK+ Game Modules (0.0.14) requires version 0.0.14
of the ggz-client-libs.

The GTK+ Game Modules are only one part of the GGZ Gaming Zone
client setup.  The following additional modules are required:
  * libggz - provides commonly used functions and low-level
    communications between client modules and the GGZ servers
  * ggz-client-libs - provides common procedures and utilites required
    to run the GGZ client and games
  * gtk-client/kde-client - one or more of the GGZ clients will be
    required in order to login to a server, chat and launch games

In addition, the following games package is available:
  * kde-games - KDE versions of many of the games in the GTK+ package
    and some unique KDE entries
  * sdl-games - some more games using the popular SDL library

The order in which these components are compiled and installed is very
important.  See the README.GGZ file for complete information on compiling
the GGZ client system.

If you encounter any bugs or have difficulty compiling, please report bugs
via the bug tracker on our SourceForge project page, or send an email to the
developer's mailing list.
