	* :

	  - show exit confirmation dialog
	  - improved statusbar message after game startup


2005-04-15 17:54:31  Rev 7107   jdorje

	* :
	  Preliminary abandoned-seats patch.
	  In principle when a player leaves a running game, his seat becomes
	  abandoned.  He may later rejoin and reclaim his seat, or after a 
	  while
	  he may be given a forfeit.  For the most part this should be 
	  controlled
	  by the game or by ggzd according to the game's options.
	  This patch introduces the preliminary changes for this.  A new 
	  seat type
	  GGZ_SEAT_ABANDONED is added, and basic changes are made to support 
	  it.
	  What is missing is ggzd and ggzdmod support for toggling between 
	  player,
	  abandoned, and open seats.  There's also no forfeit mechanism yet 
	  (although
	  the game may do this by hand if desired).
	  This patch came from the playground; see patches/abandoned.diff 
	  for its
	  history.


2005-03-11 07:43:05  Rev 6983   jdorje

	* :
	  Add missing parameter type.


2005-03-11 07:35:30  Rev 6982   jdorje

	  old C standards

2005-01-25 18:57:38  Rev 6903   jdorje

	* :
	  Change ggzmod event handler functions to take a const data 
	  parameter.


2005-01-24 01:39:48  Rev 6866   jdorje

	* :
	  Change the way channels are created at the client side.  The GGZ 
	  client
	  does not create the channel.  Instead the channel connection data 
	  is sent
	  to the game which makes the connection itself.  This means ggzmod 
	  needs
	  to call the channel-creation function from within ggzcore, adding 
	  a new
	  library dependency.  This is solved by linking ggzcore in along with
	  ggzmod inside AC_GGZ_GGZMOD.

	  Allow a resizable chess board!


2004-11-03 19:00:41  Rev 6239   jdorje

	  Images are
	  now rendered at runtime.

2004-10-16 16:07:39  Rev 6195   josef

	* :
	  - support new map format over the wire
	  But this doesn't mean yet it uses the specified graphics,
	  nor can it handle game data downloads :(


2004-07-18 00:37:08  Rev 6153   josef

	* :
	  - changelog update


2004-07-17 02:30:07  Rev 6132   josef

	  - introduction of 'common' messages as a separate catalog (not

	  - German translation updates


2004-03-14 00:29:47  Rev 5970   jdorje

	* :
	  Run animations based on time rather than frame count.  This makes 
	  animation
	  speed consistent across different computers and allows better 
	  performance
	  on faster computers.  Remove the "faster animation" and "smoother
	  animation" options.


2004-02-21 19:26:49  Rev 5959   jdorje

	    reference to CVS.
	  - Propogate the changes back into all modules.


2004-02-21 08:32:25  Rev 5955   jdorje

	* :
	  Add a table chat widget to ggzcards.  This makes the table too 
	  tall, so
	  the cards are squeezed together a bit more.  It may still be too 
	  big.
	  Perhaps a smaller deck would help.


2004-02-21 08:17:22  Rev 5954   jdorje

	* :

2004-02-06 20:31:52  Rev 5811   josef

	* :
	  - don't display enable_gettext anymore since NLS macros are used
	  This is in line with the gtk+ client.


2004-02-05 10:46:53  Rev 5790   josef

	* :
	  - synchronized NEWS, README.GGZ and QuickStart.GGZ from docs
	  - updated README
	    * new URLs for developers, bugs, website
	    * no more per-package maintainer mention (it was never valid 
	  anyway)

	  - ChangeLog updates

2003-12-04 08:22:11  Rev 5698   jdorje

	  Use the AC_GGZ_DEBUG macro to determine debugging info.


2003-12-04 07:15:41  Rev 5693   jdorje

	* :
	  Use AM_CONFIG_HEADER instead of AC_CONFIG_HEADER.  This is 
	  required by
	  automake.

	  - remove ggz.modules installation kludge

	  includes
	  and ldflags from libggz as well.


2003-07-16 09:45:05  Rev 5621   jdorje

2003-01-12 12:21:49  Rev 5324   dr_maux

	  - include <stdlib.h>, dunno why this was necessary


2003-01-12 11:54:38  Rev 5321   dr_maux

	  [powerpc]
	  - create makefile for chess' bitmaps directory


2003-01-12 11:53:56  Rev 5320   dr_maux

	* :
	  [powerpc]
	  - of course, now bitmaps is a subdir


2003-01-12 11:53:13  Rev 5319   dr_maux

	* :
	  [powerpc]
	  - have own makefile for bitmaps so automake 1.4 doesn't get confused


2003-01-12 11:46:24  Rev 5318   dr_maux

	* :
	  [powerpc]
	  - create makefile in combat's default theme dir


2003-01-12 11:44:33  Rev 5317   dr_maux

	* :
	  [powerpc]

	  doesn't get
	    confused


2002-12-15 10:13:29  Rev 5286   jdorje

	* :
	  Put @GTK_CFLAGS@ into INCLUDES, not CFLAGS.  This allows
	  'make CFLAGS="..."' to work.


2002-12-15 10:05:12  Rev 5284   jdorje

	* :
	  Auto-detect GTK or GTK2.0 linkage.


2002-12-15 08:23:37  Rev 5282   jdorje

2002-11-05 23:56:07  Rev 5225   dr_maux

	  Start adding map selection feature for Hastings:
	  - Gtk+ selection widget
	  - two new map images
	    (those are really huge as XPM...)


2002-11-04 09:02:53  Rev 5211   jdorje

	* :
	  When compiling with GTK2, use GdkPixbuf to load and render the card
	  images.  This means we don't have to worry about masking (it just 
	  works,
	  which it didn't before) and also the images may eventually be 
	  stored in

2002-11-04 07:45:38  Rev 5208   jdorje

	* :
	  - Move XPM files into a common location.
	  - XPM files are (still) installed into GGZDATADIR/pixmaps/
	  - Spades and La Pocha dynamically load the cardsets.
	  - Note, although you can build gtk-games with only some game 
	  modules,
	    the XPM files will be installed regardless.  This is a good 
	  tradeoff
	    for only having to install them once.


2002-11-04 07:19:23  Rev 5207   jdorje

	* :
	  Install the pixmaps with the game, and load them from the
	  GGZDATADIR/pixmaps/ directory.


2002-11-04 07:10:00  Rev 5206   jdorje

	* :
	  Label XPMs as such, with a /* XPM */ at the top.


2002-11-04 05:57:51  Rev 5205   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove all-cards.xpm from the repository/distribution; just use
	  ../ggzcards/cards-1.xpm instead.
	  Ideally these pixmaps will be loaded at runtime and converted into 
	  PNG
	  files.


2002-11-04 02:47:56  Rev 5201   jdorje

	* :
	  Set the game options dialog and the game popup dialog as transient
	  children of the main window.


2002-11-04 02:42:43  Rev 5200   jdorje

2002-11-03 10:11:42  Rev 5168   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix the drawing of path lines under GTK2.  This was another color
	  problem...


2002-11-03 09:38:36  Rev 5167   jdorje

	* :
	  When compiling with GTK2, use an appropriate stock icon for the exit
	   dialog.


2002-11-03 08:59:28  Rev 5166   jdorje

	* :
	  When compiling for GTK2, use stock items for the dialog buttons.
	  Since this is not compatible with GTK1.2 compilation, it's a bit 
	  of a waste
	  to do too much of it at this point.  But it _is_ much prettier.


2002-11-03 07:54:39  Rev 5165   jdorje

	* :
	  Pass the main dialog window to the exit dialog function.

	* :
	  The exit dialog should also have the main window as its transient 
	  parent.
	  This means the game will have to pass us the main window.


2002-11-03 07:06:55  Rev 5163   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix a typo bug (that only affects GTK1.2 compilation).


2002-11-03 06:31:19  Rev 5162   jdorje

	* :
	  Disable the bid_on_table option in GTK2.


2002-11-03 06:29:01  Rev 5161   jdorje

	* :
	  Set the main window as the transient parent for the bid window.  
	  This
	  causes the bid window to be properly centered on the parent window,
	  and
	  to stay above it.  It mostly invalidates the need for the 
	  bid_on_table
	  option (which is a good thing, because that option doesn't work in 
	  GTK2).


2002-11-03 03:24:24  Rev 5160   jdorje

	* :
	  Under GTK2, give the fixed widget its own window.


2002-11-03 03:18:15  Rev 5159   jdorje

	* :
	  Under GTK2, gived the fixed widget its own window.


2002-11-03 03:07:10  Rev 5158   jdorje

	* :
	  When handling a button press event on the table, return TRUE if we
	  actually handle the event.


2002-11-03 02:06:42  Rev 5157   jdorje

	* :
	  Mark the main window as non-resizable.


2002-11-02 22:48:09  Rev 5154   jdorje

	* :
	  The font name shouldn't be a const char * because it generates a 
	  compiler
	  warning.


2002-10-31 00:21:09  Rev 5126   jdorje

	* :
	  - Handle only a button_press_event on the player list.
	  - Change the prototype of player_clist_event accordingly.
	  - Return TRUE if the event is handled.


2002-10-30 23:32:58  Rev 5125   jdorje

	* :
	  Provide a separate fixed font string for GTK2.


2002-10-30 22:18:43  Rev 5123   jdorje

	* :
	  Use explicit color names with GTK2 since RGB values don't work 
	  (for some
	  reason).


2002-10-30 22:12:20  Rev 5122   jdorje

	* :
	  - Use GtkItemFactory to create menus.
	  - Use "standardized" gtk-games menus.


2002-10-30 21:24:38  Rev 5121   jdorje

	* :
	  - Use (or try to) a GtkTextView instead of a GtkText when 
	  compiling with
	    GTK2.
	  - Make a char* into a const char* to work cleanly with GTK2.
	  - Use ggz_strdup instead if ggz_malloc + strcpy.

2002-10-30 20:55:58  Rev 5119   jdorje

	* :
	  A small fix to the usage of the spin button for GTK2.
	  Now 'nil' will not always work, but other bids will.


2002-10-30 20:24:39  Rev 5118   jdorje

	* :
	  - Added gtkspinbutton files back in.  These _are_ needed when 
	  compiling
	    with gtk1.2.  I added a comment explaining why (the other comment
	    referred to the README which was not brought over from NetSpades 
	  4.2).
	  - #ifndef GTK2...#endif around gtkspinbutton code.
	  - The GTK2.0 spin buttons do not work the way Spades expects them 
	  to.  I'm
	    not sure why they don't, but the fact is bidding 'nil' may not 
	  work
	    properly.


2002-10-30 18:30:59  Rev 5117   jdorje

	* :
	  Don't set normal values in SpinInput() and SpinOutput(), just 
	  return FALSE
	  and let GTK do that.  Only set values when nil is involved.


2002-10-30 09:05:43  Rev 5116   jdorje

	* :
	  Some GTK2-specific code, surrounded by "#ifdef GTK2" blocks:
	    - Use GtkTextView instead of GtkText.
	    - Use gtk_style_set_font instead of directly accessing the font 
	  field.


2002-10-30 09:03:59  Rev 5115   jdorje

	* :
	  s/GTK_WINDOW_DIALOG/GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL/ to be compatible with 
	  GTK2.0.


2002-10-30 08:47:37  Rev 5114   jdorje

2002-10-30 08:43:24  Rev 5113   jdorje

	* :
	  Change a parameter from char* to const char* to work with GTK2.


2002-10-30 07:57:03  Rev 5112   jdorje

	  items.


2002-10-26 04:00:32  Rev 5042   jdorje

	* :
	  Use the common menu macros.


2002-10-26 03:59:41  Rev 5041   jdorje

	* :
	  Make game_about() and game_exit() non-static.


2002-10-26 03:58:33  Rev 5040   jdorje

	  directly.


2002-10-26 03:49:54  Rev 5039   jdorje

	* :

2002-10-26 03:48:52  Rev 5038   jdorje

2002-10-26 03:42:18  Rev 5037   jdorje

	* :
	  Avoid a segfault in dlg_players by preventing the user from 
	  selecting a
	  nonexistent (out-of-range) row.


2002-10-23 22:48:15  Rev 5018   jdorje

	* :
	  Disable the "start game" menu item when the client first starts.


2002-10-23 21:18:44  Rev 5014   jdorje

	* :
	  Provide "sit" and "stand" menu items.


2002-10-23 21:18:03  Rev 5013   jdorje

	* :
	  Provide games with callback functions do_sit() and do_stand() to 
	  let a
	  player sit down/stand up.


2002-10-22 20:32:36  Rev 5002   jdorje

	* :
	  - Enable the SIT, STAND, and BOOT choices of the player menus.  
	  (SIT and
	    STAND aren't implemented yet, but...).
	  - Add a MOVE choice to move to another seat when you're already

	  - The protocol version is bumped up.
	  - When the user right-clicks on a player, the GGZ player menu for 
	  that
	    player pops up.


2002-10-22 04:22:22  Rev 4980   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix stupid error with bit arithmetic.


2002-10-21 04:29:08  Rev 4969   jdorje

	* :
	  When DEBUG is defined, enable the menu selections on the player 
	  list that
	  request transactions.  Selecting these menu items will thus 
	  request the
	  transaction from ggzmod (although it will currently be dropped by 
	  ggzcore).


2002-10-20 05:16:58  Rev 4961   jdorje

	* :
	  Extend the popup menus associated with the player list, and make 
	  them
	  available outside of the player list.  Note that they're still not
	  actually of any use.


2002-10-19 23:09:30  Rev 4959   jdorje

	* :
	  Preliminary code to allow the player dialog to "do more".
	  Eventually, when controlling seats is possible, the GGZ clients 
	  need to
	  allow you to do it directly.  But it also needs to be possible 
	  through
	  the game client, so I'll start from there.


2002-10-18 03:46:04  Rev 4944   jdorje

	* :
	  Add spectators to the player list (if GGZ tells us about them).


2002-10-16 00:07:30  Rev 4929   jdorje

	* :
	  Improvement (hopefully :-) to acinclude.ggz.  Now each GGZ check 
	  takes
	  two optional parameters.  For instance:
	    AC_GGZ_LIBGGZ(action-if-found, action-if-not-found)
	  'action-if-found' will be evaluated if the specified module was 
	  found.
	  'action-if-not-found' will be evaluated if the module is not found.
	  This
	  is consistent with other autoconf macros.  If 
	  'action-is-not-found' is
	  empty, then an error will be emitted if the module isn't found.  If
	  'action-if-not-found' is "ignore", then the module will simply be 
	  ignored
	  if it's not found.
	  This is not entirely backwards-compatible, since "ignore" used to be
	  the first parameter to the macro.  But this way is more consistent,
	  in
	  my opinion.


2002-10-14 23:29:39  Rev 4925   jdorje

	* :

2002-10-13 08:06:19  Rev 4902   jdorje

	  - Change chess to use GtkItemFactory to create its menus.
	  - Chess now has mnemonics and keyboard shortcuts (accelerators) for
	    its menus.
	  - Chess now has a primitive 'about' dialog.
	  - The menu tooltips no longer work, unfortunately.  I put in a FIXME
	    comment about this.

	  so that _() can be used to translate the text.


2002-10-12 20:52:43  Rev 4891   jdorje

2002-10-12 20:42:19  Rev 4890   jdorje

	* :
	  Have Reversi use the gtk-games' common dlg_about code.
	  This has the side effect of fixing a bug whereby you could pop the

2002-10-12 20:34:26  Rev 4889   jdorje

	* :
	  Have Chinese Checkers use the gtk-games' common dlg_about code.
	  Also, change the dialog text so it conforms with the format the

2002-10-12 20:20:55  Rev 4888   jdorje

	* :

2002-10-12 19:51:29  Rev 4884   jdorje

2002-10-12 19:40:51  Rev 4883   jdorje

	  The only downside is that the menu accelerators had to be removed.


2002-10-12 17:20:16  Rev 4879   jdorje

	  Fix a compiler warning in ggzcards.


2002-10-12 07:39:59  Rev 4878   jdorje

	* :
	  Port Chess to GTK2.  It will continue to work with GTK1.2 as well.
	  Known bugs:
	    - (GTK2) The text area in which moves are shown can be 
	  hand-edited.
	    - (GTK2) gdk_color_parse doesn't work the way it claims, so I've 
	  chosen
	      named colors for the backgrounds.
	    - (GTK2) Selecting a piece to move seems to take a double-click
	      instead of just a drag-and-drop.
	    - All menu accelerators (which didn't work anyway AFAICT) were 
	  dropped.
	  The GTK2 port does not seem to have the graphical glitches that 
	  the GTK1.2
	  version did.  Also I fixed a bug in the GTK1.2 port which caused 
	  extra
	  (garbage) characters to be appended to the move list.


2002-10-12 01:16:33  Rev 4872   jdorje

2002-10-12 00:47:07  Rev 4870   jdorje

	* :
	  Add --with-gtk2 option for gtk-games' configure script.
	  If selected, gtk-games will be linked against GTK2.0 instead of 
	  GTK1.2,
	  and GTK2 will be #defined.  Of course, this doesn't yield very good

2002-09-26 10:57:49  Rev 4720   dr_maux

	  - deploy new acinclude.ggz
	  - no more --disable-gettext


2002-09-25 16:19:08  Rev 4700   dr_maux

	* :
	  - argh! (2nd time today already)
	  s/DIST_SUBDIRS/EXTRA_DIST/ because there are no makefiles within the
	  subdirectories.
	  Note that users will get the CVS directories together with the

	  Run "make messages" with the new N_ keyword.  This catches some 
	  extra
	  material (especially in ggzcards) that was previously untranslated.


2002-09-23 16:31:25  Rev 4669   jdorje

	* :
	  Add N_ as a keyword to mark translatable material.


2002-09-23 12:33:57  Rev 4666   jdorje

	* :
	  Many cleanups and fixes to the build system:
	    - Removed @$(NORMAL_INSTALL) and @$(NORMAL_UNINSTALL), which don't
	      do anything useful anyway.
	    - Change the "uninstall" directive to "uninstall-local" when
	      uninstalling the ggz-config module.
	    - Add -D parameter to ggz-config when uninstalling (not just when
	      installing).
	    - Expand all wildcards.  Doing otherwise breaks things at odd 
	  times.
	    - Reorder source listings to be in alphabetical order.  
	  Formatted the
	      source listings consistently throughout the package.
	    - Reorder game Makefile.am's to be in consistent order:
	      * SUBDIRS
	      * INCLUDES
	      * CFLAGS
	      * EXTRA_DIST
	      * install-data-local
	      * uninstall-local
	      * ggzexecmod_PROGRAMS
	      * source and linker information for game program
	    - Remove duplicate @GTK_CFLAGS@ entries.  @GTK_CFLAGS@ is now only
	      included as part of CFLAGS, not INCLUDES.
	    - Include chinese-checkers' pixmap template README file.
	    - Remove custom script code to install groups of data files.  
	  Instead
	      just let automake take care of it.
	    - Use $(DESTDIR) consistently and correctly.  In some places it 
	  had
	      to be added on (po/Makefile.am); in others it is not needed 
	  (and I
	      put a comment to that effect).
	    - Remove -lggz from game module LDADDs.  This is included 
	  package-wide
	      in configure.in.
	    - Renamed some files to remove spaces from their names.  Without 
	  this,
	      the build system would inevitably get confused.
	    - Touch the GGZ module config file at the beginning of a "make
	      install".  The actual mechanism for doing this is a bit of a 
	  kludge.
	      But this allows a local installation of the package to be done
	      without the file already being present.
	    - Possibly some other fixes I forgot to mention.


2002-09-23 10:16:30  Rev 4665   dr_maux

	* :
	  - Spades controls the network flow by enabling and disabling the 
	  handler. It
	    was mistakenly assigned to the game/ggzmod socket, not the 
	  game/game server
	    socket.


2002-09-23 09:06:38  Rev 4663   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixes to chinese-checkers build system:
	    - Only include @GTK_CFLAGS@ once.
	    - Remove @$(NORMAL_INSTALL) and @$(NORMAL_UNINSTALL).
	    - Rename "uninstall" target as "uninstall-local" so uninstall 
	  works.


2002-09-23 08:11:58  Rev 4662   jdorje

	* :
	  Save preferences when the prefs dialog is closed in addition to 
	  when the
	  application quits.  This is significant because often the 
	  application
	  won't quit of its own volition.


2002-09-23 07:59:45  Rev 4661   jdorje

	* :
	  By default, build the games in alphabetical order.  This is just for
	  convenience when watching the build...


2002-09-23 07:54:17  Rev 4660   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixes to the combat build/install system:
	    - Don't use wildcards when listing files - it breaks "make dist".
	      However, "make dist" is still broken because some map files with
	      spaces in them are not escaped properly (and I don't see how to
	      correct this).
	    - Don't use a custom script to install/uninstall the data files. 
	  Just
	      tell automake to do it.


2002-09-23 07:42:26  Rev 4659   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix several problems with the combat build/install system:
	    - Only use @GTK_CFLAGS@ once, in CFLAGS and not INCLUDES.
	    - Remove @$(NORMAL_INSTALL) and @$(NORMAL_INSTALL), which don't do
	      anything useful.
	    - Rename the "uninstall" target as "uninstall-local", so that the
	      "normal" uninstall isn't overridden and subdirectories are 
	  correctly
	      uninstalled.


2002-09-23 00:48:07  Rev 4656   jdorje

	* :
	  Replaced GGZ debugging type strings with macro
	  definitions.  s/"table"/DBG_TABLE/, s/"animation"/DBG_ANIM/,
	  s/"main"/DBG_MAIN/.


2002-09-23 00:05:12  Rev 4655   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed "core" (the ggz_debug debugging type) to DBG_CLIENT.


2002-09-22 23:48:23  Rev 4654   jdorje

	* :
	  Record an error message if we can't setup the table.


2002-09-19 16:18:33  Rev 4631   jdorje

	* :
	  Include gnome-client on the list of modules that use acinclude.ggz.


2002-09-18 22:34:01  Rev 4630   jdorje

	* :
	  - Only declare the AI functions (in ai.c) if DEBUG is defined.  This
	    matches the header file.
	  - Remove extra prototypes from ai.c.
	  - Clean up ai.h.


2002-09-18 22:28:26  Rev 4629   jdorje

	* :
	  Surround the unused function shadow(), and its caller, in an #ifdef
	  conditional.


2002-09-15 11:50:19  Rev 4567   dr_maux

	* :
	  - translation updates for Gtk+ games


2002-09-09 05:23:55  Rev 4492   jdorje

	* :
	  Another fix to avoid a compiler warning: use char* for pointer 
	  arithmetic,
	  not void*.


2002-09-09 04:51:32  Rev 4491   jdorje

	* :
	  - Mark function parameter lists as "void" in prototypes to avoid a 
	  compiler
	    warning, and enable stricter parameter checking by the compiler.
	  - Added the correct parameter to the prototype of board_translate.
	  - Avoid pointer arithmetic with void* - use char* instead.
	  - Added missing #include "net.h" to net.c.


2002-09-09 04:44:53  Rev 4490   jdorje

	* :
	  Marked some local functions as static.


2002-09-09 04:41:18  Rev 4489   jdorje

	* :
	  - Mark function parameter lists as "void" in prototypes to avoid a 
	  compiler
	    warning, and enable stricter parameter checking by the compiler.
	  - Add missing #include "game.h" to gtk_player_info.h.


2002-09-09 04:32:04  Rev 4488   jdorje

	* :
	  - Mark function parameter lists as "void" in prototypes to avoid a 
	  compiler
	    warning, and enable stricter parameter checking by the compiler.
	  - Changed ggz_debug("reversi", ...) to ggz_debug("main", ...) 
	  since type
	    "reversi" isn't used.
	  - Made some functions in main_win.c static.
	  - Removed a spurious printf from the options_dlg.c.  (This file is
	    generated by Glade, but I doubt Glade put the printf in there.)


2002-09-08 23:26:11  Rev 4472   jdorje

	* :
	  TTT has broken network compatability:
	  1.  The introduction of the stats part of the protocol is not
	      backwards-compatable.
	  2.  With the introduction of spectators, the handling of moves is 
	  done
	      slightly differently.  I'm not quite sure why, but connecting 
	  to an
	      old server breaks things.
	  Because of #1 we'll have to bump the proto # for 0.0.6 anyway, so 
	  I went
	  ahead and bumped it.
	  NOTE: to preserve compatability, the network portions of the 
	  statistics
	  code cannot be dependent on compile-time directives for 0.0.6.


2002-09-07 22:33:14  Rev 4450   jdorje

	* :
	  Rewrote many of the game status messages.  Some of this was 
	  necessary for
	  spectators, but I changed many others to improve syntax and add in 
	  player
	  names explicitly.


2002-09-07 18:34:27  Rev 4441   jdorje

	* :
	  Some fixes for TTT with spectators:
	    - In get_opponent_move, look at the player # the server tells us 
	  for the
	      move instead of our player # to determine whether the move is
	      'x' or 'o'.  Added some comments explaining this.
	    - Renamed get_opponent_move as get_move, since it can work for 
	  any move
	      (although the server needn't tell us about our moves).
	    - Renamed get_*** (functions to read data from server) as 
	  receive_***
	      to avoid naming conflict with the frontend function get_move().


2002-09-07 09:39:43  Rev 4433   dr_maux

	* :
	  - before the initial synchronization, set state to 'watching game'
	  - don't refer to other player as opponent when being spectator
	  - disallow moves when being spectator (= when game.num < 0)


2002-09-03 21:19:57  Rev 4401   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove an assertion in the client to allow more than one person to 
	  "play"
	  (a card from a hand) at the same time.


2002-08-20 22:15:09  Rev 4381   jdorje

	* :
	  Made a bunch of functions static.


2002-08-20 22:14:21  Rev 4380   jdorje

	* :
	  #include .h files from within .c files.


2002-08-20 22:13:47  Rev 4379   jdorje

	* :
	  Added #include "ai.h".


2002-08-20 20:49:40  Rev 4376   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed -I<directory> to -isystem<directory> to avoid warnings in 
	  gcc3.


2002-08-10 19:13:01  Rev 4358   dr_maux

	* :
	  - read player number in TTT_MSG_MOVE in Gtk+ client too


2002-08-07 06:31:57  Rev 4341   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed gtk-games to match the ggzmod API change to the
	  GGZMOD_SERVER_EVENT callback.


2002-08-02 03:35:46  Rev 4332   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated the client to use the new ggzmod.
	  This was a bit of a pain, since the server-side AI runs as a 
	  separate
	  process that uses the same client code, but does not now use ggzmod.
	  This was solved (for now) in a rather inelegant way using 
	  preprocessor
	  #definitions in the client code.


2002-07-30 09:22:24  Rev 4323   dr_maux

	* :
	  - file descriptor is -1 on startup, and is assigned later


2002-06-23 11:49:53  Rev 4272   dr_maux

	* :
	  - GGZMOD_STATE_EVENT -> GGZMOD_STATE_SERVER
	  - I played some games, they seem to work


2002-06-23 11:34:38  Rev 4270   dr_maux

	* :
	  - silence CVS for autom4te.cache


2002-06-23 11:33:21  Rev 4269   dr_maux

	* :
	  - adapt all Gtk+ games to the new ggzmod API
	  - untested, because ggz-gtk doesn't work properly yet, I'll try 
	  the unpatched
	    one for that


2002-06-22 05:19:13  Rev 4268   bmh

	* :
	  - Work with new control-channel-enabled ggzmod


2002-05-07 09:44:19  Rev 4180   jdorje

	* :
	  Added "rotation" data to the layout information for each player.  
	  The
	  rotation determines the relative positions of the text box/card 
	  box.  With
	  5 or 6 players, we switch the positions for some players so that 
	  selected
	  cards don't overwrite the text boxes of other players.


2002-05-05 21:44:03  Rev 4168   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix the card-position determination so that cards are animated out 
	  of the
	  correct positions when playing with !collapse_hands.


2002-05-05 21:18:48  Rev 4167   jdorje

	* :
	  Make sure the whole text box is redrawn when we update a player 
	  message,
	  otherwise parts of an old message may be left on the screen.


2002-05-05 20:16:23  Rev 4162   jdorje

	* :
	  Avoid a compiler warning if TRUE/FALSE/MIN/MAX have already bee 
	  defined.


2002-05-02 06:58:42  Rev 4134   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed buglet in calculation of card played: the position of the 
	  card was
	  first calculated, and then unintentionally modified before calling 
	  the
	  drawing code.


2002-05-02 06:48:59  Rev 4133   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed accidental printf statement.


2002-04-30 05:23:35  Rev 4122   jdorje

	* :
	  Update the on-table player list when the number of players changes.


2002-04-30 05:23:12  Rev 4121   jdorje

	* :
	  Doh!  Avoid passing an invalid pointer to game_alert_pointer().


2002-04-30 05:04:06  Rev 4119   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the interface of game_alert_player so that the update is 
	  made
	  _before_ the function is called, and the _old_ values are passed 
	  in to
	  the function (thus reversing its previous interface).  This makes 
	  it work
	  similarly to ggzdmod seat-change functions, and should fix the
	  synchronization problems that the client has had.


2002-04-29 17:00:34  Rev 4111   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed grammar on the end-of-game statusbar message.


2002-04-29 06:16:29  Rev 4109   jdorje

	* :
	  If use_ai is set, call start_hand() to init the ai at the 
	  beginning of
	  each hand.


2002-04-29 05:29:32  Rev 4108   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the protocol so that a REQ_PLAY also sends a list of valid 
	  plays.
	  This is necessary to get any kind of reasonably efficient behavior 
	  out of
	  most AIs.


2002-04-28 00:59:37  Rev 4099   jdorje

	* :
	  Make sure the bid and options dialogs are destroyed, even if they 
	  are
	  created, then we switch to having them be automatically selected, 
	  and then
	  a sync causes a new request to be automatically answered.


2002-04-27 22:15:35  Rev 4094   jdorje

	* :
	  Added DBG_*** debugging types to game.h.


2002-04-27 22:02:50  Rev 4093   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleanup to the handling of selected_card, and to some of the 
	  drawing code
	  in general.


2002-04-26 19:37:51  Rev 4086   jdorje

	* :
	  A (possibly) better way of handling !collapse_hand.  Now the 
	  client tracks
	  two separate hand structures, and the GUI has the option of using 
	  either.
	  There are two advantages: it does not require the hackish addition 
	  to the
	  card structure, and (closely related) it does not requre AI code 
	  to be
	  able to deal with it.  But, it does require some more complex code 
	  to
	  track two separate hand structures.  Oh well...


2002-04-26 07:26:10  Rev 4085   jdorje

	* :
	  Avoid matching a played card with an already-played card.


2002-04-26 06:18:29  Rev 4083   jdorje

	* :
	  - Added a new field to the card structure, called "meta".  This is 
	  intended
	    for internal use; i.e. it is not transferred over the network.  
	  It is
	    essentially just a great timesaver (and a mild hack).
	  - Added an option to not compact the hand as you played it.  When 
	  this
	    option is toggled off, when a card is played the rest of the 
	  hand won't
	    be filled in, but instead a space will be left where that card 
	  was.  This
	    may give a better interface, particularly in the case of dominoes.


2002-04-25 21:20:28  Rev 4080   jdorje

	* :
	  If we receive a new options request while an old options window is 
	  still
	  up, destroy the old window.


2002-04-25 20:42:26  Rev 4079   jdorje

	* :
	  Only provide the "Force Redraw" menu item when compiling with 
	  debugging.


2002-04-23 19:58:44  Rev 4064   jdorje

	* :
	  Added a means for running AI client-side, if compiled with DEBUG 
	  enabled.
	  Just drop in a server AI module in place of ai.c (currently the 
	  random
	  module is here).
	  This should be of great aid, in debugging both games and AI modules.


2002-04-23 19:40:29  Rev 4062   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove compiler warning when compiling with NDEBUG.


2002-04-23 07:36:00  Rev 4059   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the default size of drawn dominoes to make them much 
	  smaller, and
	  added a new preference allowing them to be drawn in a large size.


2002-04-23 07:13:12  Rev 4058   jdorje

	* :
	  Further, and rather rediculous, refinements to the layout system.  
	  It can
	  now handle multiple rows of cards.  Currently the dominoes cardset 
	  is set
	  to use 2 rows and the french (and all others) to use 1.
	  Also, I added a slight fix to the player-text-message drawing code,
	  as well
	  as removing a spurious (and accidental) printf from that code.
	  Unfortunately, the whole thing just keeps getting more and more
	  complicated.  Perhaps someday someone will write a fresh 
	  implementation
	  that can handle all of these different options in a cleaner manner.
	  At
	  least most of the code is pretty well modularized...


2002-04-23 05:38:53  Rev 4057   jdorje

	* :
	  Added an option, single_click_play.  When chosen, you must just 
	  click on a
	  card once to play it (instead of twice).


2002-04-22 17:19:04  Rev 4048   jdorje

	* :
	  Change the layout code so that we can expand the text box as 
	  necessary.
	  Also adjust the hand drawing to account for this.  Change the 
	  internal
	  layout of the text box slightly.


2002-04-22 01:07:22  Rev 4047   jdorje

	* :
	  Return the correct name in get_***_name functions, based on the 
	  cardset in
	  use.


2002-04-22 00:04:41  Rev 4046   jdorje

	* :
	  A different approach to using different cardsets: the type of 
	  cardset is
	  no longer stored for each card (using different cardsets together 
	  isn't
	  feasible anyway), but is transferred to the client with the newgame
	  message.


2002-04-21 23:27:00  Rev 4045   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the suit/face name arrays to functions.


2002-04-21 21:26:36  Rev 4042   jdorje

	* :
	  Some of the recent changes have subtly changed the form of the 
	  data the
	  server sends to the client, thus introducing protocol 
	  incompatibilities
	  for some games.  So I've bumped the protocol engine # up (again).


2002-04-21 08:57:54  Rev 4039   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed a longstanding typo bug in the animation code:
	  s/CARDHEIGHT/CARDWIDTH/.


2002-04-21 08:54:06  Rev 4038   jdorje

	* :
	  More fixes to the domino drawing code.  It now works reasonably 
	  well.


2002-04-21 08:14:26  Rev 4037   jdorje

	* :
	  Added UNKNOWN_CARDSET to the enumeration of possible card types.  
	  Changed
	  UNKNOWN_CARD to use UNKNOWN_CARDSET for the card type.
	  When the client receives UNKNOWN_CARDSET as the type of card, 
	  don't try
	  to initialize the card drawing code.  Also, don't setup the table 
	  before
	  we have been told the cardset type, and try to setup the table 
	  when we
	  hear the cardset type.


2002-04-21 07:53:34  Rev 4036   jdorje

	* :
	  Minor fixes to domino-drawing code.  It still doesn't particularly 
	  work.


2002-04-21 06:30:53  Rev 4034   jdorje

	* :
	  Added preliminary support for drawing dominoes.  It is untested, 
	  since the
	  server does not yet support any domino games.


2002-04-21 06:13:46  Rev 4032   jdorje

	* :
	  Added a new type of card type: CARDSET_DOMINOES.


2002-04-21 02:56:53  Rev 4030   jdorje

	* :
	  Instead of loading and initializing the card data when the table is
	  initialized (i.e. when the executable first launches), don't do 
	  this until
	  we receive a card from the server so that we know the type of the 
	  deck.
	  This will allow different deck *types* to be used seamlessly 
	  within the
	  client (once that is implemented).


2002-04-21 01:58:31  Rev 4029   jdorje

	* :
	  - Removed get_card_size, adding in get_card_width & 
	  get_card_height in its
	    place.
	  - Added in function get_card_visibility().
	  - Changed macros CARDWIDTH, CARDHEIGHT, and CARD_VISIBILITY to 
	  just call
	    the functions get_card_width(0), get_card_height(0), and
	    get_card_visibility(), respectively.
	  - Added MY_CARDWIDTH and MY_CARDHEIGHT to drawcard.c.  These are 
	  now used
	    in get_card_width()/get_card_height()/get_card_visibility().  
	  Thus the
	    values are encapsulated within drawcard.c.


2002-04-21 01:41:23  Rev 4028   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed get_card_coordinates from drawcard.h, making it static 
	  within
	  drawcard.c.  Changed the animation code to just call drawcard 
	  instead of
	  drawing the card manually (using get_card_coordinates).


2002-04-21 01:36:44  Rev 4027   jdorje

	* :
	  Added new files drawcard.[ch] to handle card drawing code.  Pulled 
	  that
	  code out of table.[ch] and layout.[ch].

	* :
	  - Changed all uses of malloc/free to ggz_malloc/ggz_free

	* :
	  - Fixed several memory leaks


2002-04-17 17:26:43  Rev 4005   jdorje

	* :
	  In the about dialog, use the "official" package version number as 
	  the
	  GGZCards version number.
	  Unfortunately, this still seems to be 0.0.5pre (!), so it's not 
	  quite
	  accurate.


2002-04-17 17:21:07  Rev 4004   jdorje

	  s/NULL/0/ to avoid a compiler warning from casting NULL to an 
	  integer.


2002-04-16 19:09:47  Rev 3999   jdorje

	* :
	  - Updated client/ and common/ code from server.
	  - Bumped protocol version # to match server.


2002-04-15 08:51:54  Rev 3991   jdorje

	* :
	  In the GtkFactoryItem initializer, changed _(...) to N_(...) so 
	  that we
	  can do i18n without trying to have a non-constant initializer.  
	  Also, I
	  added an #include <config.h> up top.
	  However, although the strings are correctly marked to be 
	  translated the
	  code never actually translates them.  I added a FIXME comment 
	  about this.


2002-04-15 07:23:26  Rev 3990   jdorje

	* :
	  Added "#include <config.h>" line to lots and lots and lots (and 
	  lots) of
	  files.
	  AFAIK this line should be included at the top of every .c and .cpp 
	  file,
	  before any other #inlcudes (so that it will affect them as well).  
	  It
	  should now be the case that this is true for all files in the ggzd,
	  gtk-games, and gtk-client modules.
	    There is one exception: gtk-games/spades/gtk_menu.c breaks if 
	  config.h
	    is #included, because doing so causes i18n to take effect and 
	  the file
	    is not prepared for this.  A separate fix will be necessary.


2002-04-15 05:29:20  Rev 3989   jdorje

	* :
	  Minor cleanups to cards.[ch] interface and code:
	    - Made card name arrays const char *'s instead of char *'s.
	    - Replaced some occurances of -1 with UNKNOWN_*** macros.
	    - Changed UNKNOWN_CARD initializer to use explicit field 
	  initializers.


2002-04-13 22:09:46  Rev 3976   perdig

	* :
	  - When changing any color of the game, initializes the color

2002-04-06 18:45:58  Rev 3785   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove duplicate cards xpm's from La Pocha: it just uses the cards 
	  from
	  the ggzcards directory directly.
	  I had lap use the ggzcards files instead of the other way around 
	  because
	  ggzcards uses additional rotated XPM files of the card fronts.  It 
	  is
	  possible the XPM files should go in the gtk-games common directory 
	  (?).
	  These XPM files are 500k in size, so removing the duplicate is a 
	  least
	  potentially a big saver in tarball size.  But a better solution 
	  would be
	  to have the images be converted to .png files and installed in a 
	  common
	  location - that way the installation/binary size could be kept 
	  down as
	  well.

2002-04-03 17:28:39  Rev 3720   jdorje

	* :
	  For consistency, handle ENABLE_NLS with AC_DEFINE (like all the 
	  other
	  macros) instead of CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DENABLE_NLS".
	  This will naturally take care of any rebuilding dependencies when 
	  NSL is
	  toggled, which the other method did not do.


2002-04-03 17:18:31  Rev 3719   jdorje

	* :
	  - Added header comment to ggzintl.[ch].
	  - Moved "#include <config.h>" up to the top of ggzintl.c, so it'll 
	  be

	  - Added "#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H" check.
	  - Removed #inclusion of stdio.h, which does not seem necessary.


2002-04-03 17:15:41  Rev 3718   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed file name in header comment.


2002-03-28 18:41:29  Rev 3711   jdorje

	* :
	  Some improvements and fixes to Reversi:
	    - Pop up a confirmation dialog when we try to exit during a game.
	    - Because of this, I had to move the conf parsing code out of 
	  main_win.c
	      and into main().  Instead of calling ggz_conf_read_string and 
	  then
	      doing a sscanf() on it, I changed this to just be 
	  ggz_conf_read_int
	      (and a similar change for the saving code).
	    - I changed (GGZ_CONF_RDRW || GGZ_CONF_CREATE) to
	      (GGZ_CONF_RDRW | GGZ_CONF_CREATE) so that the config stuff 
	  actually
	      works now.  Yay!


2002-03-28 08:27:20  Rev 3710   jdorje

	* :
	  Added GGZ-style header comments to the (non-glade-controlled) 
	  callback
	  files in Chess.


2002-03-28 08:22:02  Rev 3709   jdorje

	  In Combat, pop up a confirmation dialog any time the player tries 
	  to exit.


2002-03-28 08:14:12  Rev 3708   jdorje

	* :
	  In La Pocha, pop up a confirmation dialog when we try to exit 
	  during a
	  game.


2002-03-28 08:01:35  Rev 3707   jdorje

	* :
	  Pop up an exit confirmation dialog in dots when we try to exit 
	  during a
	  game.


2002-03-28 07:37:30  Rev 3706   jdorje

	* :
	  Show an exit dialog when the player tries to leave chinese-checkers.
	  In theory, this should only be shown when a game is in progress.  
	  But I
	  don't see how to tell this from the client end.


2002-03-28 07:32:15  Rev 3705   jdorje

	* :
	  game.theme is initially read in by ggz_conf_read_string, which 
	  means it's
	  allocated by ggz_malloc.  Therefore it must be freed with ggz_free 
	  (not
	  g_free or free), and allocated later by ggz_strdup (not strdup).  
	  Doing
	  differently leads to a segfault when we try to change themes.


2002-03-28 07:25:05  Rev 3704   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed (commented out) two unused variables from struct game_t:
	  state and got_players.
	  It appears that we never actually know the game state, and 
	  got_players is
	  tracked locally (statically) within the player-name-reading 
	  function.


2002-03-28 07:16:12  Rev 3703   jdorje

	* :
	  Only pop up the exit dialog if our state is CHESS_STATE_PLAYING.


2002-03-28 03:22:32  Rev 3701   jdorje

	* :
	  More tooltips madness.  Introduced the concept of a bid description,
	  separate from the simple bid text.  Send the bid descriptions to the
	  client when requesting a bid.  At the client end, show these 
	  descriptions
	  as tooltips if that preference is selected.
	  I added bid descriptions for Suaro and Spades, other games do not 
	  have
	  them yet.


2002-03-28 01:18:27  Rev 3700   jdorje

	* :
	  Now each option set has a single descriptive text associated with 
	  it.
	  This text is sent to the clients, and is displayed by the gtk 
	  client as
	  a tooltip for all of the relevant option choices.


2002-03-28 00:29:34  Rev 3699   jdorje

	* :
	  Improved the syntax of many statusbar messages.


2002-03-28 00:11:43  Rev 3698   jdorje

	* :
	  Added confirm_exit preference.


2002-03-28 00:00:06  Rev 3697   jdorje

	* :
	  There was a buglet when we show the bid choices on the table: the 
	  label at
	  the top of the bid selection table that says "Select your bid:" 
	  isn't
	  drawn correctly when it's placed directly on the table.  (Justin 
	  tells me
	  this is because a GtkLabel doesn't have its own GdkWindow.)
	  The workaround is to just not show that label when we have 
	  bid_on_table.
	  This is acceptable since the statusbar at the bottom of the table 
	  still
	  already says something similar.  It also has the advantage that 
	  more bids
	  can fit on the table area, so the bid_on_table option will work 
	  for more
	  games (in fact, it now works for suaro for me).


2002-03-27 08:30:36  Rev 3695   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed default preferencecs: faster and smoother animation, and 
	  show the
	  bid choices on the table.
	  The only thing questionable is showing the bid choices on the 
	  table, which
	  doesn't work cleanly for suaro.


2002-03-26 07:13:01  Rev 3688   jdorje

	* :
	  Added tooltips for the preferences.  They should all be translated
	  properly, etc., although this is untested.
	  Perhaps this can be the start of some gratuitous overuse of 
	  tooltips in
	  ggzcards...


2002-03-26 06:45:02  Rev 3687   jdorje

	* :
	  Added some i18n support for chinese-checkers.
	  I did not mess with the glade-generated files, but I did change 
	  the text of
	  the other files to be translated, set the locale to 
	  chinese-checkers, and
	  used ggzintl.h with the libgtk-games.a library.


2002-03-25 22:40:22  Rev 3685   jdorje

	* :
	  Enable i18n in ggzcards:
	    - Remove local definicions of intl macros/functions.
	    - #include "ggzintl.h" in a lot of files.
	    - Change some _(...) that was used in a non-executing context to 
	  N_(...).
	    - Call ggz_intl_init().
	  In theory, this is all that is needed for localization of 
	  client-side
	  messages to work.  Of course, most messages are still generated on 
	  the
	  server and cannot yet be translated.


2002-03-24 18:41:20  Rev 3659   dr_maux

	* :
	  - use LOCALDIR in ggzintl


2002-03-24 01:16:42  Rev 3642   jdorje

	* :
	  Use the common exit dialog to double-check if we want to exit, but 
	  only if
	  we've already started a game.  (If we've finished one game but 
	  haven't
	  started another, it will pop up the dialog.  This isn't perfect, 
	  but we
	  don't currently track whether we're actually playing a game.  It 
	  should be
	  fine for now.)


2002-03-24 00:56:22  Rev 3640   jdorje

	* :
	  Change the exit dialog so that new exit dialogs won't pop up if a

	  number.


2002-03-23 20:27:51  Rev 3633   jdorje

	  Show (slightly) different text if can_return is specified to
	  ggz_show_exit_dialog().


2002-03-23 20:04:38  Rev 3632   jdorje

	* :
	  Oops!  Added missing #include.


2002-03-23 20:02:30  Rev 3631   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed chess to call ggz_show_exit_dialog() instead of exiting 
	  when the
	  user attempts to close the client.  This meant editing the glade 
	  file
	  to change the callback for the delete event, and changing this 
	  callback
	  and the on_exit_activate() one to call ggz_show_exit_dialog().  I 
	  named
	  the new callback ExitDialog, which unfortunately doesn't match any 
	  of the
	  other chess function names (though it does match the identical 
	  netspades
	  version).
	  It might be a good idea to have the client first check to see if a 
	  game is
	  in progress before popping up the dialog.  If there's not, it 
	  might as
	  well just go ahead and exit.


2002-03-23 19:31:28  Rev 3629   jdorje

	* :
	  Put new library libgtk-games.a into directory common/.  Moved 
	  NetSpades'
	  exit dialog into this library, and linked NetSpades to it.
	  The library now contains the ggz_show_exit_dlg() function.  In 
	  time it
	  can hold others as well, so that gtk-games all have a common feel.
	  I added a wrapper function to NetSpades so that the library 
	  function can
	  have a straightforward interface.  This is the only actual code 
	  change I
	  did; everything else was just moving code around.


2002-03-23 18:36:30  Rev 3628   jdorje

	* :
	  Added header comments for callbacks.[ch].


2002-03-23 18:04:45  Rev 3627   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove some unnecessary #include directives so that the exit dialog
	  doesn't depend on other NetSpades files.
	  Also remove some unnecessary blank lines.


2002-03-23 17:56:12  Rev 3624   dr_maux

2002-03-17 00:14:56  Rev 3595   jdorje

	* :
	  Step 1 of adding i18n support to GGZCards: have the clients send 
	  their
	  language setting to the server.
	  Notes:
	    - This is actually the only step that needs be taken now, since it
	      breaks protocol compatibility.  All other changes need only be 
	  done
	      server-side.
	    - It doesn't technically "work", since the packet sent by the 
	  client
	      is not delivered by GGZ.  This will be an easy way to test any 
	  bug
	      fix for that problem.


2002-03-15 14:41:08  Rev 3556   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the expose event signal handler to return TRUE instead of 
	  FALSE.
	  This will prevent handling of the event by the widget's parent 
	  (which is
	  probably harmless but unnecessary).


2002-03-15 14:39:37  Rev 3555   jdorje

	* :
	  Return TRUE in the expose event signal handler.  This prevents 
	  further
	  handling by the widget's parents (which should be harmless but is
	  unnecessary.


2002-02-27 09:42:22  Rev 3491   jdorje

	* :
	  Split up common code into multiple files.


2002-02-27 08:40:53  Rev 3489   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved "hand" structure into common code (which is still protocol.h,
	  unfortunately).


2002-02-26 00:35:54  Rev 3470   jdorje

	* :
	  Made the card overlap amount a globally defined constant, rather 
	  than
	  hard-coding it everywhere.


2002-02-25 14:42:22  Rev 3469   jdorje

	* :
	  Added a new card parameter, "type".
	  This can store the type of the deck.  Currently we only support 
	  standard
	  (French) decks, but in theory any deck type could work.  (I'd like 
	  to
	  prove it by implementing a game using dominoes as the deck, but 
	  it'll take
	  extra work to get the graphics to work.)


2002-02-25 10:15:32  Rev 3466   jdorje

	* :
	  Add all sorts of $(top_srcdir) madness so that a "make distcheck" 
	  will
	  work.
	  Of course, it still fails later on...


2002-02-25 09:59:43  Rev 3465   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed duplicate INCLUDES directive.


2002-02-25 09:16:34  Rev 3463   jdorje

	* :
	  dded Makefiles for new directories to autoconf process.


2002-02-25 09:12:02  Rev 3461   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved "common" and "client common" code into its own directories.
	  This code is all still contained in one file right now, but it 
	  need not
	  be (and in most cases should not be).


2002-02-24 19:57:25  Rev 3457   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the game-specific messages to send the game _name_ instead 
	  of an
	  (arbitrary) game-identifying opcode.


2002-02-24 19:28:13  Rev 3455   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated common files from server.


2002-02-21 02:53:38  Rev 3431   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated client-common files from their changes in the server AI 
	  code.
	  - This means, for one, that they no longer use ggzmod (!) but 
	  access FD
	    3 directly.
	  - Consequently, I renamed them as client.[ch].  This is much 
	  better than
	    having server and client both contain common.[ch].
	  - I changed the debugging system slightly.  Debugging type 
	  "core-error"
	    was removed; instead I just use ggz_error_msg instead.


2002-02-19 14:41:25  Rev 3424   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved function cards_equal to are_cards_equal in the "common" code,
	  so
	  it'll be accessible from the client.


2002-02-19 13:06:43  Rev 3423   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the REQ_BID bid request packet to include a list of the 
	  actual
	  bids available, in addition to the bid descriptive texts.


2002-02-19 12:04:46  Rev 3422   jdorje

	* :
	  Added MSG_NEWHAND new hand message, sent from the server to the 
	  client to
	  inform them of a new bid.
	  This will generally not be used by the GUI, which really doesn't 
	  need to
	  know this information at all.  But it could be used by a 
	  client-side AI.


2002-02-19 10:59:53  Rev 3421   jdorje

	* :
	  Added MSG_BID bid message, sent from the server to the client to 
	  inform
	  them of a bid.
	  This will generally not be used by the GUI, which (in the most 
	  general
	  case) will rely on the player messages for this information 
	  instead.  But
	  it could be used by a specialized GUI or a client-side AI.


2002-02-17 16:59:31  Rev 3406   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed bug: added handling of GGZ_SEAT_NONE in update_player_clist().


2002-02-17 16:51:28  Rev 3405   jdorje

	* :
	  Added player list to splash screen and in between games.
	  I've temporarily disabled any kind of real splash screen, since the
	  drawing doesn't mesh with having a player list on the screen.  But 
	  we'll
	  see...


2002-02-17 15:16:39  Rev 3404   jdorje

	* :
	  Added player list dialog window, controlled by the "Player List" 
	  entry
	  in the Game menu.


2002-02-17 15:14:57  Rev 3402   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed bad assertion in draw_splash_screen().


2002-02-17 13:28:20  Rev 3401   jdorje

	* :
	  Added "Force Redraw" selection to Game menu.
	  Unfortunately (!), I can't manage to get myself into a situation 
	  where I
	  need to force a redraw, so I can't tell if this is necessary.  But 
	  it
	  should work.


2002-02-17 13:10:57  Rev 3400   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved to generalized preferences system.
	  The pref_types array holds the list of preferences.
	  Only booleans are currently supported.


2002-02-17 12:13:28  Rev 3399   jdorje

	* :
	  Avoid ggz_malloc'ing and ggz_free'ing a size-0 piece of memory.


2002-02-17 09:59:47  Rev 3396   jdorje

	* :
	  Polishing cleanups to the debugging system:
	    - Removed a lot of trailing \n newlines from ggz_debug calls.
	    - Change some printf calls that were hiding into ggz_debug calls.
	    - In chinese checkers, fixed game_print_board (which is currently
	      disabled) so that it will work with ggz_debug.
	    - Changed the default debugging type in Reversi to be "main" 
	  instead
	      of "reversi", to match all the other games.
	    - Added a missing #include <ggz.h> to spades/client_func.c.
	    - (off-topic) fixed a spurious compiler warning in
	      spades/gtk_dlg_stat.c by initializing noButton when it's not 
	  going
	      to be used.


2002-02-17 09:54:19  Rev 3395   jdorje

	* :
	  Change the autoconf (automake?) process so that we get a #define 
	  NDEBUG if
	  debugging is not enabled.
	  There will therefore be _either_ #define DEBUG or #define NDEBUG in
	  config.h.  With DEBUG, we get full debugging output and assertions.
	  With NDEBUG, we get neither.  It would be possible to make an 
	  intermediate
	  state that defined neither - then assertions would run, but we 
	  could (at
	  our option) have little or no debugging output.


2002-02-17 09:42:10  Rev 3394   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed hastings to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.


2002-02-17 09:29:11  Rev 3392   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed combat to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.


2002-02-17 09:17:14  Rev 3391   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed Chess to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.


2002-02-17 08:54:07  Rev 3388   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed spades to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.


2002-02-17 08:41:22  Rev 3386   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed La Pocha to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.
	  Also, I #ifdef'd out an unused function to avoid a compiler warning.


2002-02-17 08:36:07  Rev 3385   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed dots to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.


2002-02-17 08:27:43  Rev 3384   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed chinese checkers to use libggz's debugging routines.
	  Mostly this involved switching a lot of fprintf to ggz_error_msg 
	  calls.


2002-02-17 08:20:13  Rev 3383   jdorje

	* :
	  Only do GGZ_CHECK_MEM if DEBUG is specified.


2002-02-17 08:15:31  Rev 3382   jdorje

	* :
	  - Only do GGZ_CHECK_MEM if DEBUG is specified.
	  - Move debug_cleanup up next to initialize_debugging.


2002-02-17 08:02:54  Rev 3381   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed printf output to use ggz_debug instead.  Sent debugging 
	  output
	  to ~/.ggz/reversi-gtk.debug, and disabled most debugging when 
	  DEBUG is
	  not specified.


2002-02-17 07:47:26  Rev 3380   jdorje

	* :
	  Add further cleanup routines before we exit, so that the memory 
	  check
	  will be clean.


2002-02-17 02:05:13  Rev 3376   jdorje

	* :
	  Significant changes to the animation system:
	    - When we receive a MSG_TRICK message, we won't interrupt an 
	  on-table
	      animation to begin the off-table animation.  Instead we mark the
	      off-table animation to be handled once the on-table animation is
	      completed.
	    - We manually delay before starting the off-table animation after
	      receiving a MSG_TRICK (and after the on-table animation is
	      completed).  The delay is either 1 or 2 seconds, depending on
	      the "longer_clearing_delay" preference.  This is accomplished 
	  with
	      a bit of a hack; instead of queuing future events for handling 
	  after
	      the one-second delay, we just ignore the server during this 
	  time.  In
	      some situations (i.e. bridge) this could result in a bit of a 
	  buildup
	      of unhandled data, but I don't think it should be too much.


2002-02-15 04:50:33  Rev 3363   jdorje

	* :
	  Add a "select your bid" label above the bid selection, both for
	  on-the-table and dialog window bidding.


2002-02-15 04:36:48  Rev 3362   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed division-by-zero error in the calculating of the bid selection
	  dimensions.


2002-02-15 04:25:51  Rev 3361   jdorje

	* :
	  Place the bid selection box directly onto the table, rather than 
	  in a
	  separate dialog window - if the bid_on_table preference is set 
	  (turned off
	  by default).
	  There may be problems with this system - for one thing, if there 
	  are too
	  many bids (like in Suaro and Bridge) they might not fit on the 
	  table at
	  all.  There may be drawing issues as well - we'll see.  This is 
	  why it's
	  not enabled by default, although it is much more convnient than the
	  separate window.


2002-02-14 10:51:54  Rev 3357   jdorje

	* :
	  Added animation to move cards off the table.


2002-02-14 07:42:52  Rev 3355   jdorje

	* :
	  OK, forget holding on to the patch.  The behavior of the new code 
	  is so
	  much better it justifies all the pain of dealing with GDK strings...


2002-02-14 06:06:53  Rev 3354   jdorje

	* :
	  Well, this patch adds something under 100 lines to the code...but it
	  redoes the table so that it is all done with GDK, i.e. no 
	  GtkLabels are
	  used for the player texts.
	  This makes the animations prettier since the texts don't get 
	  overdrawn.  If
	  I decide to use it, it would be easy to then make the whole table a
	  GtkPixmap, which should fix all of the drawing issues.


2002-02-13 21:32:09  Rev 3353   jdorje

	* :
	  Significant change to the animation code: now it is possible to have
	  more than one animation at once.  If a new card is played while 
	  one was
	  already being animated, then both cards are animated.
	  This has a tendancy to interfere with the GtkLabels that sit on 
	  the table,
	  so I've made it an option disabled by default.


2002-02-13 09:53:05  Rev 3352   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed the animation process: instead of tracking the current 
	  position
	  and a "step" for the movement each animation, we track the number 
	  of the
	  current frame and re-calculate the position each frame.
	  This makes calculations significantly more sane, since we don't 
	  have to
	  worry about floating values or having our endpoints match up.


2002-02-13 09:15:18  Rev 3351   jdorje

	* :
	  Added two new preferences to control animation.


2002-02-13 08:58:11  Rev 3350   jdorje

	* :
	  Added a separate "animation buffer".  Now animation drawing is 
	  buffered,
	  and will flicker less.
	  This is similar to the double-buffering used by lapocha, that I 
	  removed
	  (from ggzcards) when I disabled animations long ago.


2002-02-13 07:32:47  Rev 3349   jdorje

	* :
	  Workaround for bug.
	  When table_setup is called, we expect the game to have started, so 
	  there's
	  an assertion to that effect.  But, if we join a game in progress 
	  we get
	  no MSG_NEWGAME alert so game_started will not have been set.
	  The workaround is to change the assertion to instead set 
	  game_started and
	  log an error message.  But this should be fixed server-side.


2002-02-13 04:47:13  Rev 3348   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed buglet - when we get a BADPLAY message from the server, we 
	  need to
	  redraw the cards on the table (in addition to the cards-in-hand, 
	  which
	  were already redrawn).


2002-02-13 02:48:06  Rev 3346   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated copyright and author information for each file.


2002-02-13 01:34:24  Rev 3345   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed errors in --disable-FEATURE options, for gettext and debug.
	  The format is AC_ARG_ENABLE(feature, descriptive_text, if_specified,
	                              if_not_specified).
	  descriptive_text seems to have nothing to do with the rest.  If the
	  parameter is specified, we don't want to do anything - just let 
	  configure
	  it out.  If it's _not_ specified, then we need to give a default 
	  (which
	  we do).
	  The problem before was that there was an action given for 
	  if_specified -
	  which will lock us in to that action, no matter what is actually
	  specified.
	  Anyway, it should work now.


2002-02-12 23:30:46  Rev 3342   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed Capitalization and grammar in cardlist preferences.


2002-02-12 23:23:24  Rev 3341   jdorje

	* :
	  Enabled "Show Graphical Cardlists" preference - but it doesn't 
	  take effect
	  immediately.


2002-02-11 23:26:08  Rev 3334   jdorje

	* :
	  Switch the code to increase the maximum hand size back to using 
	  realloc
	  instead of just mallocing the new hand and accepting a memory leak.
	  This
	  used to cause a segfault from time to time, but now it should not.
	  In hindsight, it's obvious why things happened as they did.  
	  Becasue the
	  buffer overrun on the hand was just 1 card (3 bytes), most of the 
	  time it
	  didn't affect anything and was untraceable.  Only for particular 
	  hand
	  sizes did things line up so that the overrun mangled malloc's 
	  internal
	  memory, and caused a crash.


2002-02-11 23:07:12  Rev 3333   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed major big mondo bug: an off-by-one error causing a slight 
	  buffer
	  overrun.
	  Guess what?  I bet this fixes all of the lingering memory problem 
	  bugs.


2002-02-11 12:47:27  Rev 3330   jdorje

	* :
	  Cast more ignored function return values to (void).


2002-02-11 12:46:54  Rev 3329   jdorje

	* :
	  Made some variables and functions static.


2002-02-11 10:52:11  Rev 3328   jdorje

	* :
	  Added (void) cast to many functions whose return values are ignored.


2002-02-11 09:12:57  Rev 3325   jdorje

	* :
	  Assorted improvements and bugfixes.
	    - Added several more assertions, to animation_start() and
	      get_card_coordinates() (this is a good one).
	    - Fixed animation: now when we play a card, table_cards isn't 
	  updated
	      until after the animation starts.  When the animation is 
	  complete,
	      the card will be actually drawn on the table.  If 
	  animation_start is
	      called again, it will return without starting if the card is 
	  already
	      in table_cards.  Therefore the bug whereby an animation would 
	  be done
	      twice should be fixed.
	    - A minor cleanup to the code for a MSG_TABLE; behavior 
	  shouldn't be
	      changed.
	    - When ggzcards.players is allocated, initialize all values in 
	  it -
	      especially table_card, which will otherwise be left invalid.


2002-02-11 08:52:13  Rev 3323   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated common files from server - added checking and debugging 
	  code to
	  read_card and write_card.


2002-02-11 07:24:37  Rev 3321   jdorje

	* :
	  Reset ggzcards.play_hand to -1 when we're not playing, and add a 
	  number of
	  assertions to make sure this invariant is maintained.
	  I also added a comment in the struct definition explaining this.


2002-02-11 06:55:47  Rev 3320   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleanup to debugging messages about protocol opcodes.


2002-02-11 06:40:29  Rev 3318   jdorje

	* :
	  Added functions to get a string description of a protocol opcode, 
	  for
	  debugging.


2002-02-11 06:22:24  Rev 3317   jdorje

	* :
	  When a play sent to us from the server has more than one possible 
	  match
	  in the player's hand (which will occur when the hand is unknown, for
	  instance), the card we pick as the match is now done semi-randomly.
	  To get random behavior, I used random() and so added an srandom() 
	  call as
	  well.
	  This has the side effect of making animations prettier, since they 
	  will
	  come from different places in the hand.


2002-02-11 05:55:42  Rev 3316   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix a minor animation problem: when we animate a card of a player 
	  with
	  horizontal cards-in-hand, the fact that we animate the card 
	  vertically
	  means it's necessary to move the card slightly so it's center 
	  appears the
	  same.
	  This has a side effect of fixing a drawing problem in some cases, 
	  where
	  the animation ran over the player labels.  But I wouldn't really 
	  call it a
	  "fix".


2002-02-11 05:06:59  Rev 3315   jdorje

	* :
	  I separated the GUI tracking of the cards on the table from the core
	  client's tracking of such cards.
	    - I added a lengthy comment describing ggzcards.players[p].
	  table_card.
	    - I created a new array, table_cards, with which the GUI tracks 
	  the
	      cards on the table.  This will _not_ mesh with what the core 
	  code
	      tracks through ggzcards.players[p].table_card.  The core code's
	      data just mirrors what the server sends us, while the GUI's data
	      is intended to track what we're actually drawing (which may be
	      different if we're animating, etc.).
	    - The animation bugs will still be present, since the animation 
	  code has
	      not been changed to take advantage of the two separate pieces 
	  of data.


2002-02-11 03:21:07  Rev 3313   jdorje

	* :
	  Added use_default_options preference.  When enabled, the client will
	  always automatically pick the default options for a game without 
	  popping
	  up a window.  This will make debugging runs just a little bit 
	  faster.
	  Also, I fixed a couple of typo mistakes in the code for the other
	  preferences.


2002-02-11 03:05:08  Rev 3312   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove table card resetting out of handle_msg_badplay(), and into
	  game_alert_badplay().  This will have no end result (since the one 
	  just
	  calls the other), but is logically clearer (since it is the table 
	  code
	  that caused the need for a reset by interfering with the core code's
	  tracking of the cards).


2002-02-11 02:39:50  Rev 3311   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed bug: when we received a play message from the server 
	  (indicating
	  a player had played a card), we didn't actually place the card on 
	  the
	  table.
	  This probably introduces a (lesser) bug elsewhere, but that's 
	  unavoidable.
	  I wrote an extensive comment about it.


2002-02-11 02:17:21  Rev 3310   jdorje

	* :
	  Minor cleanup to table_redraw(): remove some #ifdef 0'd-out code, 
	  remove
	  an unused variable, and add a comple more comments.


2002-02-11 01:29:04  Rev 3309   jdorje

	* :
	  Make comparison of card-in-hand to table card explicit (rather 
	  than using
	  memcmp, ugh) in table_display_hand().


2002-02-11 01:19:31  Rev 3308   jdorje

	* :
	  - Added write_to_screen parameter for various table_show_*** 
	  functions.
	    These functions draw to the backing store, and if 
	  write_to_screen is
	    specified they will propogate the changes straight out to the 
	  table
	    window (which was the default before for most of them).
	  - Changed table_redraw so that when it calls table_show_*** it 
	  does _not_
	    specify write_to_screen.  Instead, at the end of the function we
	    manually call table_show_table() to redraw the whole thing.  
	  This should
	    cut down (a very little) on flicker.


2002-02-11 00:44:48  Rev 3307   jdorje

	* :
	  - Renamed on_fixed1_style_set to on_fixed1_redraw_event.
	  - Connected on_fixed1_redraw_event to the size_allocate event, but
	    disabled the code for now.


2002-02-10 13:00:48  Rev 3306   jdorje

	* :
	  Miscellaneous cleanups to redrawing code.
	    - Disable table_redraw() hack in game_get_bid().
	    - Replace manual drawing code in table_setup() with a simple 
	  call to
	      table_redraw().  This should make sure that the drawing 
	  (complete
	      with the "refresh hack" in table_redraw) happens correctly.
	  As of this change, it is extremely likely that all redrawing works
	  correctly (aside from flickering, which should really not be 
	  necessary).


2002-02-10 12:33:42  Rev 3305   jdorje

	* :
	  Enable debugging by default.  Thus instead of --enable-debug as an 
	  option
	  we have --disable-debug.


2002-02-10 12:27:09  Rev 3304   jdorje

	* :
	  Miscellaneous cleanups to table-clearing code:
	    - Created new function, table_clear_table to do the work.
	    - Call it in place of old gdk_draw_rectangle(...), in two places.
	    - Move table_clear_table out of draw_card_areas (WTF was it 
	  doing in
	      there anyway???).
	    - Fixed bug where draw_card_areas were being drawn _after_ the 
	  player
	      hand information - I moved table_clear_table up above where the
	      player data was drawn (in table_setup).


2002-02-10 12:00:00  Rev 3303   jdorje

	* :
	  Miscellaneous cleanups:
	    - Changed 1 to TRUE.
	    - Added an assertion to draw_card_areas.
	    - Moved all accesses of table_ready into table.c.
	    - Moved table_ready into table.c (and made it static).
	    - Removed some excessive debugging text.


2002-02-10 11:10:05  Rev 3301   jdorje

	* :
	  Added "#include <config.h>" for files that were missing it.


2002-02-10 11:07:20  Rev 3300   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed UNKNOWN_CARD from a #definition to a const card_t.


2002-02-10 06:20:09  Rev 3295   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed the type (gint->guint) of the cb_tag field of the anim struct.


2002-02-10 01:53:42  Rev 3289   jdorje

	* :
	  - Changed 0 to FALSE and 1 to TRUE.
	  - Added some extra assertions.
	  - Changed one use of game_started to table_ready.


2002-02-10 01:51:11  Rev 3288   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed buglet/compiler warning: passing an enumeration value as an 
	  int*.


2002-02-10 01:37:50  Rev 3287   jdorje

	* :
	  At the end of the configure process, show whether gettext is enabled
	  (along with debugging and GDB debugging, already present).


2002-02-10 01:00:57  Rev 3286   jdorje

	* :
	  - Added extra comments to many functions.
	  - Made statusbar_message take a const char* instead of a char*.


2002-02-09 23:12:57  Rev 3283   jdorje

	* :
	  Added assertion and comment when resizing table buffer.


2002-02-05 22:35:11  Rev 3257   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed "#define GGZ_SEAT_OPEN -1" instruction, which was causing 
	  Reversi
	  to completely fail.


2002-02-04 07:58:51  Rev 3244   jdorje

	* :
	  Upped the protocol version numbers on all games that use the 
	  GGZSeatType
	  enumeration.
	  AFAICT, this is all games except keepalive, spades, and muehle.
	  I've done limited testing to make sure everything works as planned,
	  but
	  further testing would be good.


2002-02-04 07:56:40  Rev 3243   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed check for and linkage to unused ggzcore library.


2002-02-03 20:36:17  Rev 3228   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated acinclude.ggz from changes made in ggzd.


2002-01-21 08:09:42  Rev 3174   jdorje

	* :
	  Switched over from easysock to libggz/easysock:
	  - Changed all es_*** functions to ggz_***.
	  - Changed all #include <easysock.h> to #include <ggz.h>.
	  - Changed ggz_read_string_alloc functions to call ggz_free() 
	  instead of
	    free() on the allocated string.  Put FIXME comments by alloc 
	  calls that
	    don't seem to have associated free's.
	  - Added LIB_GGZ to the module's LDADD.
	  - Removed LIB_GGZ from ggzcards's LDADD.
	  - Removed autoconf check for easysock(0.3).


2002-01-20 08:50:01  Rev 3160   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed easysock calls to libggz/easysock ones.
	  Also included are numerous other local cleanups.


2002-01-12 10:18:48  Rev 3089   jdorje

	* :
	  Added check for libggz.


2002-01-12 10:13:19  Rev 3087   jdorje

	* :
	  Added acinclude.ggz to ggzd and ggz-client-libs.


2002-01-12 10:05:20  Rev 3086   jdorje

	* :
	  Added libggz support to acinclude.ggz.


2002-01-11 17:11:15  Rev 3063   dr_maux

	* :
	  - cleaned up the source a bit
	  - added yes/no question when attempting to quit the game
	  - updated copyrights


2002-01-09 12:47:10  Rev 3033   dr_maux

	* :
	  - did I ever tell that vim makes :%s/ggzcore_confio/ggz_conf/g 
	  very easy? :-)


2002-01-09 12:45:43  Rev 3032   dr_maux

	* :
	  - let combat also use ggz_conf


2002-01-09 12:44:17  Rev 3031   dr_maux

	* :
	  - same for reversi: use ggz_conf


2002-01-09 12:41:08  Rev 3030   dr_maux

	* :
	  - prepend GGZ_ to constants


2002-01-09 12:38:32  Rev 3029   dr_maux

	* :
	  - let Dot use ggz_conf


2002-01-08 09:21:08  Rev 3011   jdorje

	* :
	  Added acinclude to utils/ module, and updated the years on the
	  copyright notice.


2002-01-06 06:57:10  Rev 3003   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed an assertion that fails because of a server problem - 
	  eventually
	  I'll want to fix the problem, no doubt, but for now I've just 
	  removed it.


2001-12-23 04:21:52  Rev 2990   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed function game_setup_table(); added function
	  game_alert_num_players().  This makes it obvious that
	  game_alert_max_hand_size() must also redesign the table (via 
	  table_setup())
	  since there's no explicit function to do that anymore.
	  In summary, the client-common interface is a bit cleaner.


2001-12-23 03:02:33  Rev 2988   jdorje

	* :
	  Added game_started global variable to track whether we've actually
	  started playing.  It isn't set to 1 until we start our first game. 
	  If
	  not set, then we keep the splash screen up.
	  This fixes the buglet that caused the splash screen to be 
	  overwritten as
	  we tried to draw empty tables, etc., over it.


2001-12-23 02:11:02  Rev 2987   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleanup to table_initialize().


2001-12-23 00:47:37  Rev 2986   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed bug in tracking of table vs card coordinates.


2001-12-21 09:38:32  Rev 2977   jdorje

	* :
	  Numerous cleanups and fixes to the table card and animation systems.
	  - Unified table card functions, getting rid of table_clear_table.  
	  We
	    now leave the removing of the cards from the client-common data
	    structure up to the client-common code (as it should be).
	  - Try to make things work by fully redrawing the table when we have
	    a bad play.  This still sometimes doesn't work.
	  - Removed a bunch of spurious (not even implemented) functions from
	    table.h.


2001-12-21 04:19:49  Rev 2975   jdorje

	* :
	  Tiny cleanup of debugging texts.


2001-12-21 04:19:31  Rev 2974   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed bug with initialization of cardlists toggle button.


2001-12-21 02:26:28  Rev 2973   jdorje

	* :
	  Set up libggz config code so we load/save our preferences from an rc
	  file.


2001-12-21 01:45:19  Rev 2972   jdorje

	* :
	  Added a new preference choice: autostart.  If selected, the player 
	  need
	  not select "Start game" to begin a game.


2001-12-21 01:22:05  Rev 2971   jdorje

	* :
	  Added _very_ rudimentary preferences dialog.  Right now, the only 
	  thing
	  it can control is animations.


2001-12-20 03:12:45  Rev 2966   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed useful but still bad sleep(1) from end-of-trick handling.


2001-12-20 03:06:01  Rev 2965   jdorje

	* :
	  Another fix to the animation process.
	  On the last step of the animation, we're drawing the card in it's 
	  final
	  (table) position.  In this case, we don't just draw it straight to 
	  the
	  window (as we normally do with the animation) but must instead 
	  draw it
	  on the table buffer ("for real").


2001-12-20 02:59:13  Rev 2964   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed worthless/bad "sleep(1)" line that was called every time the
	  player made a bad play.


2001-12-19 23:54:36  Rev 2961   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed ANIMATION to a "preference", a globally defined boolean 
	  value (of
	  course, it's not yet settable after compile-time).  I also made 
	  another
	  preference, cardlists, that can be set to 0 to translate card 
	  lists to
	  text messages.
	  Finally, I fixed a major bug I introduced in the last commit in
	  game_alert_hand_size(), and added a comment making this clear.


2001-12-19 23:35:52  Rev 2960   jdorje

	* :
	  Added extra debugging messages to game functions; plus I did a 
	  slight
	  restructuring (improvement) of game_handle_max_hand_size.


2001-12-19 23:12:47  Rev 2959   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed the last know problem with animation: the animation graphic 
	  wasn't
	  correctly overdrawn when the animation was aborted/zipped.
	  Enabled animation by default.


2001-12-19 10:35:31  Rev 2951   jdorje

	* :
	  Great fixes to animation code.  It still has a few problems, but 
	  is now
	  mostly usable.


2001-12-19 09:49:22  Rev 2950   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed bug: when drawing a hand, the code only checked the card index
	  to see if it was the currently selected card.  Since it didn't check
	  the hand of the card, when you ask for a sync each hand is drawn 
	  with a
	  selected card.
	  The fix is easy.


2001-12-19 09:44:56  Rev 2949   jdorje

	* :
	  A little more restructuring of the table vs game code interface, 
	  including
	  removing table_play_card.


2001-12-19 09:34:42  Rev 2948   jdorje

	* :
	  A little more restructuring of the table vs game code interface.


2001-12-18 23:59:37  Rev 2946   jdorje

	* :
	  Miscellaneous code cleanups all over.


2001-12-18 23:33:44  Rev 2945   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed unused hand.[ch].


2001-12-18 23:12:39  Rev 2944   jdorje

	* :
	  Added missing #include.


2001-12-18 23:10:24  Rev 2943   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved more game-client interface code into game.[ch].


2001-12-18 22:40:48  Rev 2942   jdorje

	* :
	  Added animation debugging code.


2001-12-18 22:29:24  Rev 2941   jdorje

	* :
	  A slight cleanup of animation_zip; it can now be called whether or 
	  not
	  we're currently animating and it'll work things out.


2001-12-18 22:17:50  Rev 2940   jdorje

	* :
	  Did a large cleanup of the gui <-> client-common interface.  I 
	  moved all
	  of the gui-side interface functions into game.[ch], separating 
	  them from
	  table and dialog code.


2001-12-18 20:47:03  Rev 2939   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved animation code into a separate file.


2001-12-18 07:27:02  Rev 2931   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated animation code.  Now it almost works - but it's still 
	  disabled.
	  Uncomment the #definition of ANIMATION in game.h to use it.


2001-12-18 04:06:09  Rev 2929   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved internal (static) data into its own struct.


2001-12-17 10:11:39  Rev 2918   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed gtk-games autoconf process to use acinclude.ggz, and 
	  updated all
	  the code to use the newly renamed ggzmod functions.


2001-12-17 08:14:12  Rev 2917   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated acinclude.ggz to check for new ggzmod; added it to 
	  gtk-games and
	  gtk-client.


2001-12-17 03:22:24  Rev 2913   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up message dialog creation code, and fixed the spacing on 
	  it.


2001-12-17 03:16:36  Rev 2912   jdorje

	* :
	  Actually fixed the spacing - for real, this time - of the "about" 
	  dialog.


2001-12-17 01:50:36  Rev 2908   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up the about dialog a bit more, and fixed the spacing of 
	  the top
	  vbox.


2001-12-17 01:50:25  Rev 2907   dr_maux

	* :
	  - ensure strcmp etc. is defined


2001-12-17 01:47:33  Rev 2906   dr_maux

	* :
	  - fix i18n function


2001-12-17 01:44:59  Rev 2905   dr_maux

	* :
	  - gcc3 compat: define strcmp and abs
	  - cast array index to int (this may be questionable, but it would 
	  be a warning
	    otherwise... I'll check this)


2001-12-17 01:38:20  Rev 2904   dr_maux

	* :
	  - include string.h for strcmp
	  - comment out all unused variables; however, if they're not really 
	  useful they
	    should be erased


2001-12-17 00:59:09  Rev 2901   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated about-dialog creation code.  I also updated the listed 
	  version
	  to 0.0.5pre.


2001-12-15 20:47:40  Rev 2896   jdorje

	* :
	  An experimental patch that converts the La Pocha client to use the
	  ggzcards server and protocol.
	  To use it, apply the patch and copy over common.[ch] and protocol.
	  [ch]
	  from gtk-games/ggzcards.
	  Again, this is just an experiment, and done mostly to test the 
	  robustness
	  of the ggzcards client common libraries.  It will crash every now 
	  and then,
	  for reasons unknown.


2001-12-13 15:53:48  Rev 2892   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed "OK" to "Close" in the dialog windows.


2001-12-13 14:39:48  Rev 2891   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed table_alert_player so we don't get spurious notifications 
	  of a
	  player joining the game.


2001-12-13 14:26:54  Rev 2890   jdorje

	* :
	  Now debugging logs go to a file, ~/.ggz/ggzcards-gtk.debug.  Also I
	  cleaned up main() a little bit.


2001-12-11 07:18:13  Rev 2877   jdorje

	* :
	  Remove all unnecessary #definitions of GGZ_SEAT_OPEN, and instead
	  #include <ggz_client.h> where necessary.


2001-12-11 06:23:29  Rev 2873   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed GGZdModSeat to GGZSeatType.


2001-12-11 06:15:35  Rev 2872   jdorje

	* :
	  Several cleanups to the core system:
	    - Changed the hand structure to a straight typedef.
	    - Reverted the buggy realloc call in increase_max_hand_size, so 
	  that it
	      now just malloc's every time (leaking memory, but without a 
	  crash).
	    - Changed table_get_options to return an int.  Returning a 
	  negative
	      value will allow the default options to be used.  (Perhaps 
	  this should
	      be a true-false system instead.)
	    - Added table_alert_newgame function, to alert the table 
	  (frontend) when
	      we receive a newgame message (newgame actually starting) from 
	  the
	      server.


2001-12-11 00:05:03  Rev 2871   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed two function names (of table callback functions).


2001-12-10 23:34:01  Rev 2870   jdorje

	* :
	  If the server sends us any hand before we've set up the table, we
	  just ignore it.  This prevents the ugly drawing of empty hands over
	  the splash screen when playing multiplayer.


2001-12-10 23:03:45  Rev 2868   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed table_alert_player_name(player, name) to
	  player_alert_player(player, status, name).  It now sends the GGZ 
	  seat
	  status of the seat.  The table frontend uses this information to 
	  give
	  helpful joining/leaving messages.


2001-12-10 22:07:26  Rev 2866   jdorje

	* :
	  Renamed global "game" variable to ggzcards.


2001-12-10 20:29:38  Rev 2862   jdorje

	* :
	  Restructured the message system of the protocol.  I also took this
	  opportunity to add a lot of comments to protocol.h.


2001-12-10 17:17:29  Rev 2860   jdorje

	* :
	  Inserted a hack to redraw the table each time we get a bid request.
	  This
	  more-or-less works around the problems I was seeing before where 
	  the table
	  wouldn't get drawn properly, and large expanses of it would appear 
	  blank.
	  There is some flickering, as clearly the the blank space is still 
	  being
	  drawn (and then immediately overwritten) - I really need to track 
	  down
	  this bug.


2001-12-10 17:03:06  Rev 2859   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up table_setup().


2001-12-10 17:02:23  Rev 2858   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up handle_msg_hand.


2001-12-10 07:29:52  Rev 2857   jdorje

	* :
	  Two changes:
	    - Fix the cardlist dialog so it will dynamically resize if a 
	  different-
	      sized cardlist is sent.  This is currently only needed for La 
	  Pocha.
	    - Fix the gameover message so that it will not be immediately
	      overwritten by the newgame request message, and fix its 
	  grammaer.


2001-12-10 07:10:08  Rev 2856   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed small memory leak.


2001-12-10 06:34:27  Rev 2855   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed typo in earlier commit.


2001-12-10 05:46:45  Rev 2854   jdorje

	* :
	  More separation of bid and options code.


2001-12-10 05:18:58  Rev 2853   jdorje

	* :
	  Oops.  Added files missing from last commit.


2001-12-10 04:57:56  Rev 2852   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed up the bid and options dialogs.  They'll now be appropriately
	  destroyed when a new bid/option request comes in, or the user makes
	  their bid/options choice.


2001-12-10 04:19:50  Rev 2851   jdorje

	* :
	  Allowed a new option request to override the old one, rather than
	  barfing on it.


2001-12-10 04:16:28  Rev 2850   jdorje

	* :
	  Allowed a bid request to override a previous bid request.  I also 
	  fixed
	  up several other minor problems (like a missing free()), and added 
	  some
	  more debugging messages.


2001-12-10 03:07:39  Rev 2845   jdorje

	* :
	  Added some comments, particularly on the memory-management 
	  situation.


2001-12-10 02:19:53  Rev 2843   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed things around so ggzcards-client now uses libggz for memory
	  management and debugging.


2001-12-10 00:16:21  Rev 2841   jdorje

	* :
	  When a newgame request is received, the client no longer 
	  automatically
	  sends the response.  Instead, you must choose "Start Game" from 
	  the game
	  menu for the reponse to be sent.


2001-12-09 23:23:58  Rev 2838   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed "edit" menu; moved "preferences" under "game" menu.


2001-11-13 22:58:05  Rev 2742   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed deprecated WH_ prefixes.


2001-11-13 22:19:42  Rev 2740   jdorje

	* :
	  Added "sync" menu item.


2001-11-08 21:20:22  Rev 2700   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed bug: we no longer allow the bid or options dialogs to be 
	  destroyed.


2001-11-08 20:52:37  Rev 2699   jdorje

	* :
	  Clear pixmap before drawing cards on it for cardlist canvas.


2001-11-08 10:09:24  Rev 2696   jdorje

	* :
	  Added names by card lists.
	  The card list is out of order.  It's probably sent that way by the 
	  server.


2001-11-08 09:41:54  Rev 2695   jdorje

	* :
	  Cardlist messages now show the cards graphically.
	  There are some probems with this - there are no names shown with the
	  cardlist (as there should be), and I think the ordering is wrong.  
	  I'll
	  fix these later.


2001-11-08 08:25:23  Rev 2694   jdorje

	* :
	  Corrected dialog window use.


2001-11-08 01:05:23  Rev 2692   jdorje

	* :
	  Translate card list information to text on-the-fly.
	  Eventually this will be replaced by graphics for the cards.


2001-11-05 12:01:01  Rev 2674   dr_maux

	* :
	  - ooops, those slipped through my previous removal as it seems


2001-10-29 03:39:56  Rev 2626   jdorje

	* :
	  Fix small problems with previous commit.


2001-10-29 03:36:53  Rev 2625   jdorje

	* :
	  Experimental code: make a text message out of the cardlist message.


2001-10-28 09:50:30  Rev 2621   jdorje

	* :
	  Added client-side stuff to handle cardlist messages.
	  Although these are not shown in the GUI yet, the core 
	  infrastructure is in
	  place for them.


2001-10-28 07:54:44  Rev 2618   jdorje

	* :
	  I've had enough of the fixed messaging system.  Although incredibly
	  flexible, it's very limiting in terms of user interface issues.
	  So, I changed the protocol to allow different types of global 
	  messages
	  to be passed to the client.
	  Each message is still identified by a "mark" that is a single 
	  string.  In
	  the simplest case, the client can (and currently does) use this 
	  mark just
	  as the name of the message (for instance for the items on the 
	  "Messages"
	  menu).  In more complicated cases, the client may use this as an 
	  index
	  into its own system (ultimately this may be a reason for switching 
	  over to
	  an XML-style protocol, but that's a question for another day).
	  However, there are now different "types" of global messages.  The 
	  simplest
	  one is a "TEXT" message that is the same as the messaging system 
	  used now:
	  a single string, intended to be displayed as-is in a fixed-width 
	  font by
	  the client.  A second type of message is the "CARD GROUP" message, 
	  which
	  consists of a group of cards (one card per player).  A third is 
	  the "CARD
	  LIST" message, which consists of a list of cards (n cards per 
	  player).
	  (The card list message could be viewed as a superset of the card 
	  group
	  message, but since the display for the two is generally quite 
	  different
	  I've kept it like this for now.)  A final one is the "BLOCK" 
	  message,
	  which includes game-specific information that may or may not be 
	  used by
	  the client (in a format to be determined later).
	  For compatibility, I also bumped the protocol version number up.
	  It should be remembered that this is an experimental system; I'm 
	  really
	  going to have to see how things shake out as I go along.  The card 
	  group
	  and card list systems should be good enough to start with, once I 
	  put
	  together some code to use them.  After that, I'll see how things 
	  fall
	  together for the game-specific system.


2001-10-08 23:09:23  Rev 2545   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed table_verify_hand_size(), which was really ugly.  Now 
	  there's a
	  table_alert_hand_size(max_hand_size) instead.  This alerts the 
	  table to
	  the maximum hand size.
	  The table may then wish to increase this value so as to for 
	  everything to
	  fit (as the GTK client does).


2001-10-08 19:22:30  Rev 2544   jdorje

	* :
	  Replaced explicit casts from ints to gpointers with 
	  GPOINTER_TO_INT and
	  GINT_TO_POINTER.  Changed int's to be gints.


2001-09-14 07:18:43  Rev 2475   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up table code.


2001-09-09 15:36:23  Rev 2427   dr_maux

	* :
	  - Found an unused game :)
	  - This will, if ever, go into kde-games. It was placed here before 
	  the modules
	    split.


2001-09-09 02:54:18  Rev 2415   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed misnamed value "seat" in the seat structure to "assign".  
	  I also
	  made note that it is not used (although it is communicated as part 
	  of
	  the comm protocol).


2001-09-09 02:44:20  Rev 2413   jdorje

	* :
	  Made correction read_seat -> es_read_int.


2001-09-09 02:04:55  Rev 2412   jdorje

	* :
	  Corrected protocol version information.


2001-09-09 00:06:17  Rev 2411   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated to newer version of protocol-common code, and changed 
	  function
	  names to use this new interface.


2001-09-08 23:21:57  Rev 2406   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated protocol.* files from the server, and updated the 
	  client-common
	  code to use the new interfaces.


2001-09-08 19:22:48  Rev 2402   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed incorrect assertion.


2001-09-07 09:55:05  Rev 2387   jdorje

	* :
	  Added protocol.c with new common server-client code, removed 
	  similar code
	  from common.[ch], and updated Makefile.am to reflect the new file.


2001-09-07 08:43:35  Rev 2385   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed unnecessary (I think) sleep(1) call upon starting a new 
	  game.


2001-09-07 08:40:00  Rev 2384   jdorje

	* :
	  Moved two more game_*** functions into game.[ch].


2001-09-07 08:25:36  Rev 2383   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed unneeded (nearly worthless, in fact) ggz_snprintf() 
	  function.  I
	  fixed one set of code to correctly work without having this 
	  wrapper for
	  snprintf.


2001-09-07 07:55:42  Rev 2382   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed unused cb_bid.[ch] files.


2001-09-06 02:27:46  Rev 2381   jdorje

	* :
	  Use g_malloc and g_free in GUI code instead of malloc and free.


2001-09-06 02:26:21  Rev 2380   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed rediculous extern declarations.


2001-09-05 23:52:11  Rev 2379   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed the worst code ever.
	  The behavior should be identical, but instead of leaving around a 
	  pointer
	  to be freed at some distant location we free it immediately after 
	  using
	  it.  It's now up to the function being called to copy that data if
	  necessary.


2001-09-05 22:19:19  Rev 2377   jdorje

	* :
	  Reviewed all code, cleaned up a lot of it and fixed a few small 
	  bugs.


2001-09-05 21:40:11  Rev 2376   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated client's version of the protocol header file (copied from 
	  the
	  server code).


2001-08-28 06:34:52  Rev 2303   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated ggzmod check to look for ggz_connect instead of 
	  ggz_client_connect.


2001-08-25 20:13:38  Rev 2248   jdorje

	* :
	  Switched games to using ggz_*** naming convention, and added
	  ggz_disconnect() calls for all games.


2001-08-25 15:42:06  Rev 2246   jdorje

	* :
	  Switched over all remaining gtk-games to use libggzmod.
	  This was so easy I figured I'd go ahead and just do it.  I haven't 
	  tested
	  any of them, but they didn't work before so there's no loss.


2001-08-24 02:45:21  Rev 2213   jdorje

	* :
	  Update Chess to use GGZMod, removing old GGZ files and changing 
	  function
	  calls to match the current GGZMod standard.


2001-08-23 22:19:38  Rev 2212   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated gtk-games to use the new libggzmod.


2001-08-23 21:27:24  Rev 2205   jdorje

	* :
	  "Fixed up" spades to work with libggzdmod.
	  It doesn't *really* use libggzdmod, it just uses 
	  ggz_client_connect to
	  get the socket FD.  Obviously a lot more cleanup is possible.


2001-08-20 08:45:39  Rev 2183   jdorje

	* :
	  Upgraded La Pocha GTK client to use libggzmod.


2001-07-24 00:30:45  Rev 2085   jdorje

	* :
	  Added significantly to doxygen documentation.  See
	  http://devon.dhs.org/ggz/doxygen/ggzcards/.


2001-07-24 00:01:53  Rev 2084   jdorje

	* :
	  Slight cleanup in common.c.


2001-07-23 23:47:14  Rev 2083   jdorje

	* :
	  Set game.state to WH_STATE_INIT in client_initialize (client 
	  common code)
	  rather than game_init (frontend code).


2001-07-23 23:38:03  Rev 2082   jdorje

	* :
	  Added a little bit to doxygen documentation.


2001-07-23 13:07:48  Rev 2081   jdorje

	* :
	  Added client_send_sync_request function, and used it in the case 
	  of a bad
	  match on a play message (along with a brilliant comment on why it's
	  necessary).


2001-07-23 13:01:31  Rev 2080   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed problem with multiply freeing options data (oops!).  Also 
	  cleaned up
	  that code a little bit.


2001-07-23 11:35:01  Rev 2079   jdorje

	* :
	  Added _( ) markers around more translatable strings.  I think I 
	  got them
	  all, but there still aren't very many since most are created by the
	  server.


2001-07-23 08:27:12  Rev 2078   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed selected_card field from seat_t structure, since this data 
	  is
	  frontend-specific.  Added static selected_card variable to table.c;
	  now
	  there's just one variable instead of one per player.


2001-07-23 08:20:56  Rev 2077   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed unused message field of seat_t structure.  (How long has 
	  it gone
	  unused, I wonder?)


2001-07-23 08:13:23  Rev 2076   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed length restriction from player names.


2001-07-23 08:00:49  Rev 2075   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up/added to doxygen documentation.


2001-07-23 07:56:35  Rev 2074   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned things up a tiny bit by replacing struct seat_t with seat_t.


2001-07-23 07:47:48  Rev 2073   jdorje

	* :
	  Practically finished client-common pseudo-library.
	  It's not really a library, just three separate files: common.[ch] 
	  and
	  protocol.h.  The rest of code works off of this pseudo-library 
	  through
	  a system of function calls and callbacks.  The interface to the 
	  library
	  (in common.h) is documented using doxygen; see
	  http://devon.dhs.org/ggz/doxygen/.
	  I really don't know how to effectively split this code off into a 
	  real
	  library so that multiple clients can use it.  It should go into a 
	  ggz
	  module, but none fits.  Should a ggz-game-libs module be created?  
	  Would
	  this be of use to other games?  The way it is now, updating it 
	  would be
	  a mess with multiple client frontends, and the code itself is just 
	  a big
	  jumble of functions in common.c.  I could partially split it off by
	  placing it in a separate directory within ggzcards, but this is an
	  irrevocable step (using CVS) so I won't do that just yet.
	  TODO: After reviewing this code, there are several points in it 
	  that need
	  to be updated/expanded on/cleaned up.  I don't remember where they 
	  all are
	  right now, but when I read this later I'll probably remember most 
	  of them.


2001-07-23 00:38:33  Rev 2072   jdorje

	* :
	  Added more code to the common pseudo-library: the messaging code.  
	  Also
	  added some additional comments to the library interface.


2001-07-23 00:07:53  Rev 2071   jdorje

	* :
	  Removed docs.html file - this contained instructions for La Pocha, 
	  which
	  is no longer appropriate.


2001-07-23 00:03:11  Rev 2070   jdorje

	* :
	  Added $Id: ChangeLog 7942 2006-03-16 15:15:01Z josef $ headers to all (well, almost all) files.
	  Note that the commit will in itself will make the last-modified 
	  dates of
	  all the files useless to begin with.


2001-07-22 23:41:11  Rev 2069   jdorje

	* :
	  Test of CVS (RCS) keyword substitution for $Id: ChangeLog 7942 2006-03-16 15:15:01Z josef $.


2001-07-22 23:38:42  Rev 2068   jdorje

	* :
	  Expanded "common" code slightly, moving ggz_debug to it and removing
	  game.fd in favor of ggzfd.


2001-07-22 23:09:24  Rev 2067   jdorje

	* :
	  Created the rudimentary beginnings of a common client library in
	  common.[ch].


2001-07-19 20:08:55  Rev 2059   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed cards-*.xpm entries in Makefile.am.


2001-07-19 01:16:53  Rev 2054   jdorje

	* :
	  Cleaned up code; removing some extra commented-out code.


2001-07-19 00:43:50  Rev 2053   jdorje

	* :
	  Set up GGZCards to use libggzmod.
	  This was quite easy:
	  	- Removed the old ggz_connect code.
	  	- Instead of calling ggz_connect, call ggz_client_init and
	  	  ggz_client_connect.
	  	- Call ggz_client_quit before exit (not totally necessary).
	  All the rest should be taken care of by autoconf.


2001-07-18 23:27:30  Rev 2052   jdorje

	* :
	  Added check for ggzmod library/header files, and added -lggzmod to 
	  link
	  with the library.


2001-07-18 21:18:23  Rev 2049   jdorje

	* :
	  Inserted manditory 1-second pause at the end of a trick before 
	  clearing
	  the cards.  Ideally, this would be made an option.


2001-07-17 04:10:20  Rev 2038   jdorje

	* :
	  Added separate check for easysock library/header file to configure.
	  in.
	  Previously, the check was just a part of the ggzcore library check,
	  so if
	  easysock wasn't present the error would be "Cannot find ggzcore 
	  library".


2001-07-14 20:05:00  Rev 2020   bmh

	* :
	  - Set ProtocolVersion to 1 to match server description files


2001-07-14 03:59:46  Rev 2016   bmh

	* :
	  - Bumped version to 0.0.5pre
	  - Use new ggz-config syntax (--fromfile -> --modfile)
	  - New .dsc file format (Protocol -> ProtocolEngine, ProtocolVersion)


2001-07-11 20:36:39  Rev 1991   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed variable names in hand_read_hand() so that there's no 
	  identifier
	  shadowing.


2001-07-11 03:31:00  Rev 1984   jdorje

	* :
	  "Fixed" the bug that was causing the La Pocha clients to crash.  
	  This was
	  caused by a seg fault in the client when, on the _second_ time 
	  that the
	  client had to increase it's hand size, free() was called to 
	  destroy the
	  old hand.
	  Calling free() here wasn't a good idea to begin with - it should be
	  realloc, since it's possible that we need to save some of the hand 
	  data.
	  However, I have no clue why free() would fail on what seems to be a
	  perfectly normal g_malloc'd pointer.  To fix it, I have simply 
	  removed
	  the free() call - creating a memory leak.


2001-07-10 20:16:10  Rev 1970   jdorje

	* :
	  Updated credits section ("About" dialog window): removed Windows 
	  client
	  and added Game Modules/AI Modules.


2001-07-08 20:29:56  Rev 1942   jdorje

	* :
	  As jzaun suggested, I switched some of the text to be a 
	  fixed-width font
	  so that the server can do more formatting of the data (using 
	  whitespace).
	  I really didn't know what I was doing, so the result may be less 
	  than
	  ideal.  However, I think it's a step forward.  Currently only the 
	  message
	  windows use the fixed-width font, but ultimately all messages should
	  probably do so.


2001-07-08 08:00:45  Rev 1939   jdorje

	* :
	  Inserted checks on labels being NULL to avoid having GTK complain 
	  about
	  failed assertions.
	  The problem is that the server sends text messages (player names, 
	  player
	  messages, etc) as soon as they become available, but the client does
	  not set up the table until it first receives a hand (at which time 
	  it
	  first has an idea of what size the table should be).  Thus, before 
	  the
	  first hand is sent any messages will be worthless _as far as the 
	  graphics
	  go_.  However, these messages are saved and used when the table is
	  set up, so there shouldn't be any problem with the current system
	  other than its lack of elegance.
	  An alternative would be to setup the table earlier, most likely as 
	  soon
	  as the client finds out how many players there are.  However, we'd 
	  have
	  to guess at the hand size and end up having to re-setup and 
	  re-size the
	  table later when the hand is sent.  This would be ugly for the 
	  user; it's
	  cleaner just to leave the splash screen up the whole time.
	  The only real drawback of the current system in this regard is if 
	  the
	  hand size changes.  The client remembers the "maximum hand size", 
	  which
	  it uses for sizing the table.  When the first hand is received, the
	  max hand size is set and the table is setup.  If a larger hand then
	  follows, the table will be set up again, most likely with a resize 
	  at
	  the same time.  There might even be strange games where we'd want to
	  resize the window to be smaller, not leaving it at the _maximum_ 
	  hand
	  size but basing it upon recent hand sizes.  Making these possible 
	  would
	  require additions to the protocol which I do not consider 
	  worthwhile,
	  so are likely to remain as they are.


2001-07-07 07:53:36  Rev 1936   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed another buglet: another duplicate #define.


2001-07-07 07:51:46  Rev 1935   jdorje

	* :
	  Fixed two buglets: a missing return statement, and a duplicated 
	  #define.


2001-07-07 07:51:12  Rev 1934   jdorje

	* :
	  Replaced remaining uses of es_read_string with es_read_string_alloc.
	  Really, we don't know how long these strings can be, so this is the
	  best way to go.


2001-07-07 06:10:51  Rev 1933   jdorje

	* :
	  Changed several es_read_string's to es_read_string_alloc's, making 
	  buffer
	  overflow (resulting in lost characters that screw us later on) far 
	  less
	  likely.


2001-06-27 19:42:44  Rev 1865   jdorje

	* :
	  A slightly cleaner implementation of the message windows.


2001-06-27 19:34:20  Rev 1864   jdorje

	* :
	  There's that pesky bug\!  es_read_string fails catastrophically 
	  when the string is longer than the buffer given.  
	  es_read_string_alloc does the trick.  I'll have to fix this in 
	  several other places as well.


2001-06-27 05:52:46  Rev 1861   jdorje

	* :
	  Slightly improved message window implementation - autoupdating of

	  cards to fit on the table.

2001-06-25 20:57:58  Rev 1831   jdorje

	  Added blank background for splash screen.

	  skipped over as a 'table card'.

	  was heavily modified before being imported.


2001-06-18 02:46:19  Rev 1743   rgade

2001-03-05 21:00:00  Rev 1201   perdig

	* :
	  - Moved ggzcore.h above game.h so the build works again.

	* :
	  Improve handling of checking to see if we're

2001-02-20 18:04:00  Rev 1136   perdig

	  the best solution by now)
	  - Client clock now works
	  - Added a menu to request a time update from the server (useful 
	  for Server clock)
	  - When using client clock, every 15 seconds send a MSG_UPDATE to 
	  the server, telling that in the last 15 seconds he hasn't done 
	  anything. (to avoid player that are out of time just refusing to 
	  move, and so don't telling the server that they are out of time)


2001-02-19 23:21:30  Rev 1132   bugg

	* :
	  Fix the bugs that were reported to me by jzaun

	* :
	  Fix (haha, Fix- more like try to fix) a bug
	  that caused mates in which there was a piece that
	  would have been able to interpose if it wasn't pinned
	  to be recognised as checks.
	  I haven't tested this with the game that broke it,
	  but the patch has passed regression testing- and
	  everyone (jzaun, perdig) wants me to commit in the form
	  that it is.

	  number instead of 0)
	  - Players names show up in the main window (instead of "White" and

	  - Draw a small arrow besides the player's name to show the current 
	  turn


2001-02-17 16:28:41  Rev 1106   bugg

	  a draw


2001-02-12 01:12:28  Rev 1076   perdig

	* :
	  - When moving a piece, highlight the place where it currently is 
	  and the place
	    where it is over, if it's a valid move. (ie, you can easily know

	  unecessary traffic)

	  though)


2001-02-09 20:13:34  Rev 1070   perdig

	* :
	  - Changed all images from xbm to xpm (so that I can use 
	  transparency and keep
	    the images with two colors). Besides, any better looking xpms 
	  are welcomed.
	    (to test them, just overwrite the existing ones)
	  - Draw the pieces on the board (it will draw depending on the 
	  current board
	    state. As we can't move yet, the only thing you can see is the 
	  initial setup,
	    but trust me)
	  - Get the seat information from the server. Started doing the 
	  event system

	  server yet

	* :
	  - When the user closes or click cancel on the options dialog, it

	  support for it
	    on the server is not yet)

	  - Fixed a lot of bugs
	    - No more GTK error messages

	  string passed, so
	    that it can be used after the call
	  - Uses the combat_options_check function to check if it should 
	  send the current
	    options to the server. If it can't, tells the user what has gone 
	  wrong (and
	    doesn't erase the map)


2000-12-23 13:49:08  Rev 939    perdig

	  can have an
	    idea of how to name it when saving it.
	    - This only works if the host player has given a name for the 
	  map, ie, if
	      this map was loaded from a file or if the player has saved it 
	  after
	      designing it.


2000-12-20 15:16:50  Rev 930    perdig

	* :
	  - Added more information to the map editor (how many of each tile 
	  type, the
	    total of units used until now), to make it easier to create a map


2000-12-20 00:14:37  Rev 929    perdig

	* :
	  - Made the map editor use the combat_game struct to store the game 
	  information,
	    instead of a different format (as it was supposed to be since 
	  the beggining)
	  - Added a "Save" button to the map editor (no more need to start a 
	  game in
	    order to save a map)


2000-12-19 22:38:17  Rev 928    perdig

	* :

	  play a map
	    until the end to save it


2000-12-16 02:12:15  Rev 922    perdig

	* :
	  - You can now delete a map from the list (and it will delete the 
	  file as well,
	    as long as you have user permissions to do that)
	  - Display a (ugly) confirmation dialog before removing the file


2000-12-15 21:51:50  Rev 920    perdig

	* :
	  - Added a new map
	  - "make install" install the maps on $ggzexecdir/combat/maps, 
	  usually
	    /usr/local/lib/ggz/combat/maps
	  - The games now reads your maps from the $ggzexecdir/combat/maps and
	    $home/.ggz/combat/maps
	  - When saving a map, it will try to save it under 
	  $ggzexecdir/combat/maps. If
	    it doesn't have enough permissions, it will save it under
	    $home/.ggz/combat/maps (creating the directory if that's the case)
	  - All map related functions are now done in the map.c file


2000-12-10 12:49:49  Rev 919    perdig

	* :
	  - Made the names of the maps display fine in the maps list (Only 
	  the map name,
	    not it's name + hash)
	  - Selecting a map in the maps list does a quick load on it (will 
	  be used later,
	    when we have previewing of the maps working)
	  - As the map is being loaded anyway, generate his hash and check 
	  if it matches
	    the one in the filename. If it doesn't (the map was manually 
	  edited or his
	    filename doesn't have the hash), rename the file to the correct 
	  name.
	  - Changed the name of the Default and the 8x8 map to have the hash 
	  as well
	  - Added map from last game w/ Justin


2000-12-09 21:28:58  Rev 918    perdig

	* :
	  - Changed the API in combat.[ch]
	  - Added the number of players to the combat_game structure
	  - Implemented saving of maps. (when the game is over, it will 
	  search your
	    maps directories and will see if you have a map whose hash 
	  matches the
	    current one. If you haven't, it will ask you to save it)


2000-12-09 18:51:32  Rev 917    perdig

	* :
	  - Fixed a segfault when couldn't find any map


2000-12-09 16:34:47  Rev 916    perdig

	* :
	  - Renamed the "default" map to "Default"
	  - Added another map (The 'chessboard' one from
	    http://www.inficad.
	  com/~ecollins/stratego/stratego-rule-variations.htm)
	  - Made loading of maps work. Some notes though:
	    - You must run the ggz client from the combat source directory, 
	  or it won't
	      find your maps (it will search for them in the ./maps dir)
	    - You can't save a map yet, so you will have to write it by hand


2000-12-09 15:08:19  Rev 915    perdig

	* :
	  - Added confio.[ch] and lists.[ch] files
	  - Added a default map (not being loaded yet)
	  - The map lists loads *all* the visible files on the "./maps" subdir
	  - Clicking on the "Load" button returns the correct filename of 
	  the selected
	    file. (That will be different from what is showed on the maps 
	  list)
	  - Added Rich's ROL algorithm to calculate the Hash of a map (not 
	  being used
	    yet)
	  TODO:
	  - Load the map from the file (this weekend it will be working, I 
	  guess)


2000-12-09 14:59:12  Rev 914    perdig

	* :
	  - Fixed bug in confio_write_list (the same one that was in 
	  ggzcore's confio.c)


2000-12-09 00:38:47  Rev 913    perdig

	* :
	  - Modified protocol to include game options (details in combat.h)
	  - Added O_NAME option (Map name)
	  - Tells the user when can't recognize the options sent by the server
	  - Removed some unecessary code


2000-12-08 23:20:47  Rev 910    perdig

	* :
	  - Added Justin`s Load/Save Maps dialog


2000-12-05 18:12:18  Rev 904    perdig

	* :
	  - Made the background pixmap buttons and labels non sensitive 
	  (won't implement
	    it until I get some nice background images)
	  - Added an about dialog


2000-12-04 19:26:10  Rev 901    perdig

	* :
	  - changed game's _ggzcore_confio_parse and file_parser to accept a 
	  autocreate
	    argument
	  - made the game autocreate a config file if it doesn't exist (call
	    _ggzcore_confio_parse w/ autocreate = 1)
	    This fixes all the bugs that were happening with the config 
	  files not being
	    found or not able to be writen on


2000-12-03 20:46:19  Rev 899    perdig

	* :
	  - Created a options dialog, with the background color, last played 
	  color and
	    background pixmap
	  - Implemented changing of background color and last played color
	  - Saves this options to ~/.ggz/reversi-gtk.rc
	  Knows bugs:
	    - If this file doesn't exist, it won't save the options the 
	  first time the
	      game is run, but only on the following
	    - As _ggzcore_confio_parse was returning -1 when the file didn't 
	  existed, it
	      was never saving anything. So I removed that check, but some 
	  other stuff
	      may be broken because of that. (probably the first bug is 
	  because of it
	      also)... not the best solution, but it worked by now... later 
	  I'll see the
	      best way of fixing that. (should I create the file first, and 
	  then call
	      confio_parse?)


2000-12-03 20:39:36  Rev 898    jzaun

	* :
	  - Added Hastings to configure


2000-11-23 20:44:22  Rev 877    dr_maux

	* :
	  -initial CVS import
	  -nothing has changed since the last tests...


2000-11-12 20:44:18  Rev 869    perdig

	* :
	  - Fixed bug with big maps (some variables were chars instead of 
	  ints), which
	  	made some units impossible to move
	  - Fixed bug on edit map dialog (made clicking on the right spot a 
	  bit
	  	difficult)


2000-11-11 01:00:01  Rev 864    jzaun

	* :
	  - Some changes to the option dialog


2000-11-11 00:45:33  Rev 863    perdig

	* :
	  - Aded glade files


2000-11-10 23:13:50  Rev 862    perdig

	* :
	  - Implemented setup of the number of initial units
	  - Fixed bug when using a map bigger then 10x10 (the main board now 
	  resizes
	  	nicely)
	  - You can set up almost any initial army, and almost any initial 
	  map, making
	  	for virtually ilimited ways of playing the game


2000-11-10 00:16:54  Rev 858    perdig

	* :
	  - Added options dialog, to set up a starting game. Currently works:
	  	- Set up the initial map
	  - Known bugs:
	  	- As you can't currently set up the initial army, you must use 40 
	  starting
	  		positions for each player, or the server won't accept your setup.
	  	- It may work with more than 40 starting positions, but I haven't 
	  tested it
	  		yet
	  	- It won't work with maps bigger than 10x10 (the options dialog 
	  handles it
	  		nicely, but the client won't resize its board)
	  	- It may work with maps smaller then that... hadn't tested it yet
	  - Todo:
	  	- Add a "Load default" button


2000-10-29 14:45:10  Rev 845    perdig

	* :
	  - Improved border around last unit (thicker and w/ better color)
	  - Added a border around the currently selected unit
	  - Fixed "ghost" bug (when drawing a already dead unit)


2000-10-28 17:32:02  Rev 844    perdig

	* :
	  - Added a menu item for the "Show/Hide enemy units" option
	  - Only shows the enemy unit used on the last move (like on the 
	  original game)
	  - Draws a little border around the last from and to tiles (needs 
	  some work, though)


2000-10-28 16:00:25  Rev 843    perdig

	* :
	  - Added the combat source dir to the list of possible pixmaps 
	  locations
	  	That means that you don't have to do a "make install" to run 
	  combat from
	  	any directory. (as long as you don't move the original sources)


2000-10-28 04:10:05  Rev 842    perdig

	* :
	  Renamed tiles with pixmaps


2000-10-28 03:48:06  Rev 841    perdig

	* :
	  - Install the pixmaps


2000-10-28 03:33:34  Rev 839    perdig

	* :
	  - Installs pixmaps file on $(GAMEDIR)/combat/pixmaps (usually
	  	/usr/local/lib/ggz)
	  - Added this directory as a pixmap directory
	  	(In short: As long as you've done a "make install", you can run 
	  ggz from
	  	any dir that combat will find his pixmaps)
	  - Besides, renamed the tiles dir to pixmaps


2000-10-27 19:51:02  Rev 836    perdig

	* :
	  - Fixed little bug with the units power (Displayed '2' for Spy, 
	  '3' for Scout,
	  	etc)


2000-10-26 23:50:25  Rev 835    perdig

	* :
	  - Displays a little message when the server protocol is different 
	  from the
	  	client protocol
	  - Correctly receives and analyzes a sync message
	  - Added a "Request Sync" item at the menubar
	  - Requests game sync when the "Request Sync" menu is clicked


2000-10-23 00:43:03  Rev 831    perdig

	* :
	  - Added a status message with the outcome of the attacks (who won, 
	  who lose)


2000-10-22 15:37:43  Rev 828    perdig

	* :
	  - Added the common functions to check if a move is valid (in 
	  combat.[ch])
	  - Now uses this functions to check if it should send the move to 
	  the server


2000-10-21 15:46:36  Rev 824    perdig

	* :
	  - Fixed the -1/1 bug (When you were attacked by a unit of same 
	  power and both
	  	died)
	  - When updating the unit list, it oesn't clears the entire list 
	  and insert it
	  	all again. Now it only changes one collumn. (So it remembers the 
	  previous
	  	selection)
	  - Rewrote the setup subroutines. Now it should work a lot better
	  - Added a small statusbar, next to the main statusbar, with the 
	  current turn
	  												- Removed the horizontal scrollbar from the unit list
	  													(I don't think anyone will need it, and it occupied
	  													space)


2000-10-21 15:41:30  Rev 823    perdig

	* :
	  - Some minor graphical changes
	  	- Removed the "B" and the "F" from the bomb and flag pixmaps
	  	- Moved the numbers around in the other pixmaps, so that they 
	  aren't so
	  	close to the main image


2000-10-20 23:50:40  Rev 820    perdig

	* :
	  - Now handles user input in the moving state
	  	- Selects the current unit
	  	- Selects where it is going to move / who it is going to attack
	  	- Sends a CBT_REQ_MOVE
	  	(Must add some sanity checks)
	  - Receives CBT_MSG_MOVE or CBT_MSG_ATTACK from the server and do 
	  the moving
	  	logic
	  - Some minor bug fixes
	  				- Receives a CBT_MSG_GAMEOVER from the server and ends the game

	  - The unit numbers are white and bigger


2000-10-15 18:33:24  Rev 806    perdig

	* :
	  - Some small improvements on the tiles (all of them have the same 
	  size and
	  	now have a small id on their side)
	  - Gets player names from the server (and display them)
	  - Improvements on the drawing subroutines (all of them respect the 
	  tiles
	  	transparency)
	  - Allow user to setup his pieces (but can't send them to the 
	  server yet)


2000-10-14 18:44:20  Rev 802    perdig

	* :
	  - Added some (very!) experimental tiles, so that we can continue 
	  the client
	  development
	  - Loads the tiles and display them on the board
	  	(Note: ggz must be running from the combat dir or it won't work)


2000-10-14 04:23:13  Rev 796    perdig

	* :
	  - Forgot to add this files before... ops! :)

	* :
	  - Bunch of autoconf/automake changes to accomodate easysock 
	  detection
	    and build it internally if not found


2000-10-10 00:22:59  Rev 779    perdig

	* :

	  - Added a play again button


2000-09-27 20:54:16  Rev 742    perdig

	* :
	  - Shows last played move
	  - Changed the version to 0.1 (0.0.1 isn't fair to the lots of 
	  changes the module recently received)


2000-09-27 20:14:48  Rev 741    perdig

	* :
	  - Added .libs to .cvsignore
	  - Added dot.xpm (xpm used to mark the possible moves). Forgot to 
	  add it before!


2000-09-27 19:44:57  Rev 740    perdig

	* :
	  - Shows possible moves for the current player

	  - Put Makefile.am in CVS, not Makefile.  Oops!


2000-09-24 22:57:12  Rev 731    bmh

	* :
	  - Added reversi client game module from Ismael Orenstein


2000-09-04 11:28:56  Rev 707    bugg

	* :
	  Shuffle the header files around so we can
	  build ggz (no ggzd yet) on the BSDs. ggz may now be
	  built like such:
	  curly% GTK_CONFIG="/usr/X11R6/bin/gtk12-config" \
	  CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
	  ./autogen.sh
	  The CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are so it can find popt.h and -lpopt,
	  respectively.  It would be nice if they searched here as well
	  by default, so you'd only have to specify the location of
	  gtk12-config.


2000-08-30 22:40:46  Rev 701    bmh

	  - doc updates for release

	    - Display current bidder's seat with a (B) after name ((DB) if 
	  dealer too)

	  - Added license notice


2000-07-28 05:29:48  Rev 643    rgade

	* :
	  - Commented out move-ahead of server response support
	    - This seems to cause some undesirable effects which are 
	  difficult to debug
	      as it only happens when a server is lagged (which fortunately 
	  doesn't
	      happen locally, although it'd make debugging easier :)


2000-07-28 05:08:38  Rev 641    rgade

2000-07-26 07:12:51  Rev 633    rgade

	* :
	  First (semi)playable version of La Pocha
	  WHAT WORKS
	  ----------
	  - Cards are dealt out properly, per rules - deal passes to the right
	  - Trump is chosen by cutting the remainder of the deck in a random 
	  fashion
	  - Bidding is properly dealt with, per the rules - to the left
	  - Trick play is properly dealt with, cards must be played by the 
	  rules
	  - End of hand play is properly dealt with, score calculated and 
	  sent to clients
	  WHAT DOESN'T WORK
	  -----------------
	  - Leave/Rejoin is not functional (and is going to be hell to 
	  implement)
	  - Hands which use the full deck will not function (could crash? 
	  not sure)
	    - Don't play past the hand where 9 cards are dealt ;)
	  - End of game is not detected


2000-07-24 02:04:35  Rev 628    rgade

	    the score information from server


2000-06-30 04:18:53  Rev 616    rgade

	* :
	  Initial checkin of La Pocha server.
	  Current status:
	  - Clients can connect and a sample 10 cards are dealt by the server.
	  - No game play is functional.
	  - Player one is told to play (so card animation can still be tested)
	  Bugs:
	  - Far far too numerous to mention, but nothing that appears to 
	  make either
	    server or client unstable


2000-06-27 04:05:02  Rev 613    rgade
