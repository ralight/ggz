<title><i>20.01.2008: Developer snapshot 0.99.1</i> (by josef)</title>
<link>http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/</link>
<full>
Over the past months, the GGZ project was shaped like probably never before,
and our roadmap plans for a version 1.0 have been fulfilled by now. Therefore,
we part from our 0.0.x release scheme and release a series of 0.99.x snapshots
on the way to GGZ 1.0, The first such snapshot has just been
<a href="/releases/snapshot/">created</a> and can be downloaded by interested
developers. It took one year to blossom out, although the next one will take
significantly less time, about two months or so.

<title><i>10.01.2008: GGZ turns 8 years old</i> (by josef)</title>
<link>http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/</link>
<full>
The GGZ project has just turned 8 years old today. And there's indeed a reason
or two to celebrate the event. Just recently, our new
<a href="http://hq.ggzgamingzone.org/">project server</a> has been inaugurated,
complete with <a href="http://hq.ggzgamingzone.org:8010/">buildbot</a> and
<a href="http://mail.ggzgamingzone.org/">searchable mail archives</a>.
Before that, the
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/ruby/2007/12/18/creating-games-in-ruby-part-2.html?page=last">second part</a>
of an article on Ruby game development was published which mentions GGZ.
The GGZ libraries have been
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointTwentyone/ExternalDependencies">accepted</a>
as a build dependency for <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGames/">gnome-games</a>
2.21 which means wider availability of the libraries for us and more consistent
network gaming for them!
Likewise, KDE 4.0 will be released tomorrow and contains 2 games with GGZ support.
And soon, there will be another cool news, from what we've heard already... :-)

<title><i>27.08.2007: Development news</i> (by josef)</title>
<link>http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/</link>
<full>
There are many interesting things going on in GGZ land: our cards players
<a href="http://games.ggzcommunity.org/">keep on rocking</a>, a TOC had
been organised in the meantime, and a host privilege tool (cake bakery) is
in the making. The loom of KDE 4 brings us <a href="/gameclients/kreversi/">three</a>
<a href="/gameclients/kbattleship/">new</a> <a href="/gameclients/ksquares/">games</a>,
hooray! The server goes international, with many pending Unicode improvements.
The Community platform is being extended with a Web Services API and OpenID support.
Andrea O.K. Wright gave a talk in Raleigh, NC, USA about Ruby game development
which included several slides on GGZ and protocol source code generation with
<a href="http://dev.ggzgamingzone.org/protocols/">GGZComm</a> in particular.
Finally, lots of small changes which will at some point bring a new release of GGZ!

<link>http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/</link>
<full>
The GGZ Gaming Zone Project is proud to announce version 0.0.14 of its
integrated platform for free online games.
The webpages were improved, and we're getting more players now than we
ever got before. GGZ is being adopted by more game developers.
We will now focus on stability and new features in two separate lines
of development in order to not break the existing game experience.

<title><i>25.10.2006: Development news</i> (by josef)</title>

<full>
GGZ is working together with other people to give you the best choice
of online games! The <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-games/">GNOME games project</a>
will use GGZ as its networking platform, the first results of this can be seen in
a few months. The popular <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Linux distribution
is hosting a developer summit where one GGZ developer is invited to help end the myth
that playing games on Linux is difficult. And finally,
the Spades craze at <a href="http://games.ggzcommunity.org/">GGZ Community</a> will soon
be improved with a scheduling tool. We already have set up a
<a href="https://mail.ggzgamingzone.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/hosting">mailing list</a> for tournament
hosting requests which is well received. Stay tuned!

<title><i>05.07.2006: Some restructuring</i> (by josef)</title>
<link>http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/</link>
<full>
We would like to apologize in advance for some server moves,
temporary URLs in the meantime and so forth. GGZ is honoured by the amount
of new players we got (especially Spaders) and we try to provide an
adequate infrastructure. Please play on the test server if you use the
<a href="http://members.ii.net/~bredow/ggz/">Java applet</a>
(or <a href="ggz://oojah.dyndns.org">native clients</a> from SVN sources,
as the 0.0.14 release will be delayed due to all of that).
