<b>GGZ 0.0.13 Release Announcement</b><br>
<br>
<i>About the GGZ Gaming Zone</i><br>
The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players from all over the world can
login and sit at tables where they can play their favorite games and chat
with other players. GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels,
and records your statistics so you can see how you match up against other
players.
19 game servers (plus 8 GGZCards engines) and 28 game clients (plus
8 GGZBoard games and 6 GGZ-Java games) are available in total, as well as
7 independent game projects which provide GGZ support.
