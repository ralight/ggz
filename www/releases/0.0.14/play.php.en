<i>How to start playing</i><br/>
A complete GGZ installation (main server, game servers, 3rd party games, web
interface and chatbot) is available at
<a href="https://www.ggzcommunity.org/">GGZ Community</a>.
Start a GGZ core client, register during the login process (or on the website itself)
and then use desktop applications and the website to manage your games.
More information is available in the <a href="/documentation/">player guide</a>.
<br/><br/>
To play without installation (but you need Java 5 installed), GGZ Community now
contains a <a href="http://www.ggzcommunity.org/games/">Java applet</a>
to play many GGZ games in the browser. Have fun!
