<b>About the GGZ Gaming Zone</b><br/>
Founded in early 2000, GGZ has grown from a simple network game architecture to a versatile
online gaming center, entirely based on Free Software (Open Source).
With its integrated player ranking system and features such as game spectators, player
invitations, guest players and the surrounding chat system, it makes game module development
an easy task. Even more so since several game support libraries have been written.
<br/><br/>

Projects like <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-games/">GNOME Games</a> and
<a href="http://games.kde.org/">KDE Games</a> and
<a href="http://dev.ggzgamingzone.org/external.php">several other</a> game projects use
GGZ to get a powerful multiplayer infrastructure.
<br/><br/>

<i>Some statistics</i><br/>
