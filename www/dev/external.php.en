<b>External games development</b><br>
For historic reasons, the term external game refers to a game which is not part of
GGZ but does provide (conditional) GGZ support.
This page serves as a central resource for adding GGZ support to existing games.

<i>Success stories ;)</i><br>
There is a lot of effort being put into existing projects so that they can be played
on GGZ. Before going into the details, the current list should be kept in mind:

<table class="list">
<tr><td>T.E.G.</td><td>good support</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/teg/">info page</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Kamikaze</td><td>basic support</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/kamikaze/">info page</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tuxman</td><td>unknown</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/tuxman/">info page</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>CGoBan</td><td>basic support</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/cgoban/">info page</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Widelands</td><td>alpha</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/widelands/">info page</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Freelords</td><td>alpha</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/freelords/">info page</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Freeciv</td><td>good support</td><td><a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/freeciv/">info page</a></td></tr>
</table>

Of note is that Widelands implements a whole client including game lobby, and CGoBan runs totally
unmodified using a helper script binding it to GGZ. Do not hesitate to speak to GGZ developers to find
out which of the above games (or a game from GGZ) is similar to yours.
<br><br>

<i>Documentation</i><br>
For people who are totally unfamiliar with GGZ, the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/overview/">user intro</a>
as well as the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/overview/architecture/">developer intro</a>
are a must-read.
If you're still not convinced that GGZ support is a plus for your game, read the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/ggzfeatures.html">list of features</a>.

Then, it is recommended to start with the conceptual documentation on how a
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/modules/">GGZ game module</a>
works.
<br><br>

To make the implementation of this model very easy, the
<a href="/libraries/ggzmod/">ggzmod</a>
and
<a href="/libraries/ggzdmod/">ggzdmod</a>
library can be used in your game client and server, respectively.

For packaging and distribution of the game including GGZ support, as well as some
other aspects, the rather complete
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/guides/gamedev/">game development guide</a>
is a reliable reference. It explains the file formats, gives some hints etc.

The above links should be everything that is needed. For even more information,
check out the ggz-docs package, preferably using SVN, to read the old
external games HOWTO and the documentation written for the GGZ games Hastings,
GGZCards and Tic-Tac-Toe.
