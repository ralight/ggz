<b>Target platforms for GGZ</b><br/>
Over time, four major platforms (and a few minor ones) were defined which
should all be enhanced with GGZ technologies. The platforms are the KDE and
GNOME desktops, SDL for embedded games and Java for browser games.
<br/><br/>

<i>KDE platform</i><br/>
The KDE platform <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/packages/">packages</a>
encompass ggz-kde-client and ggz-kde-games. The
<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE project</a> provides GGZ support from KDE 4
on.
KDE uses the <a href="http://mdcc.cx/pub/autobook/">GNU Autotools</a> for
building software in KDE 3, but will switch to
<a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> in KDE 4.
Programming is done in C++.
Relevant libraries for games are <a href="/libraries/ggzmod/">kggzmod</a>
(client) and <a href="/libraries/ggzdmod/">kggzdmod/ggzdmod++</a>
(server).

<br/><br/>

<i>GNOME platform</i><br/>
The GNOME platform <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/packages/">packages</a>
encompass ggz-gtk-client and ggz-gtk-games. The
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME project</a> also has been providing GGZ
support from version 2.18.
GNOME uses the <a href="http://mdcc.cx/pub/autobook/">GNU Autotools</a> for
the build process.
Programming is done in C.
Relevant libraries for games are <a href="/libraries/ggzmod/">ggzmod</a>
(client) and <a href="/libraries/ggzdmod/">ggzdmod</a> (server).

<br/><br/>

<i>SDL platform</i><br/>
The SDL platform <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/packages/">packages</a>
encompass ggz-sdl-games and ggz-python.
SDL uses <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">GNU autoconf</a>
for the build process. For SDL/Python, the Python distutils shall be used
instead in the future.
Programming is done in C and Python.
Relevant libraries for games are <a href="/libraries/ggzmod/">ggzmod/pyggzmod</a>
(client) and <a href="/libraries/ggzdmod/">ggzdmod/pyggzdmod</a> (server).

<br/><br/>

<i>Java platform</i><br/>
The Java platform <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/packages/">package</a>
is simply ggz-java.
Java uses <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a> for its build process.
Programming is done in Java.
All libraries are part of ggz-java and are not installed separately for the
time being.

<br/><br/>

<i>Other platforms</i><br/>
GGZ applications also run on terminals (command-line applications, e.g.
ggz-grubby, ggz-utils, ggz-txt-client and ggz-server) and on the web (web
applications, e.g. ggz-community).
However, while these platforms are very suitable for infrastructure work,
little to none game development happens on them.
