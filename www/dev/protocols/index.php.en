<b>GGZ Game Protocols</b><br/>
Some GGZ games communicate using binary opcode protocols, others prefer XML
protocols or line-based ones. There is a format called GGZComm which can be
used to describe the protocol in an abstract way, build the networking source
code from it automatically, and auto-generate some XHTML documentation for it.
The ggzcommgen executable and the sample files can be found in the ggz-utils
package.
<br/><br/>

While XML protocols and line-based ones exist in all sorts of varieties,
binary communication usually follows two basic protocol mechanisms: unquantized
protocols and quantized protocols. The <a href="binary.php">binary protocols</a>
page lists some information about them and implementations.
<br/><br/>

<i>Protocol XML files</i><br/>

The following list of games does already have a formal
protocol description by means of a ggzcommgen file.
<br/><br/>

<a href="helloworld.protocol">Hello World</a> (for tests)
<br/>
<a href="ccheckers.protocol">Chinese Checkers</a>
<br/>
<a href="chess.protocol">Chess</a>
<br/>
<a href="dots.protocol">Connect The Dots</a>
<br/>
<a href="ggzcards.protocol">GGZCards</a> (for all GGZCards games)
<br/>
<a href="hastings.protocol">Hastings</a>
<br/>
<a href="muehle.protocol">Muehle</a>
<br/>
<a href="tictactoe.protocol">TicTacToe</a>
<br/>
<a href="bogaprot.protocol">Bogaprot</a> (for several GGZBoard games)
<br/>
<a href="connectx.protocol">ConnectX (Four-in-a-row)</a>
<br/>

<br/>

<i>XHTML versions</i><br/>

The generated XHTML pages are available in the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/protocols/">documentation section</a>.

<br/><br/>

<i>Standard protocols</i><br/>

GGZ tries to use standard protocols whenever they are defined and in use
somewhere. Please tell us if such a protocol should be used to make GGZ games
work with other games!
Right now, only <i>GMP</i> (the Go Modem Protocol) is implemented for the
GGZBoard Go network module and the Go server as an analyser around GNU Go.
Our Chess server and clients do not follow <i>XBoard</i> but that might be
changed in the future. The chess server does however support logging in the
<i>PGN</i> format (Portable Game Notation), and the chess savegame handler in
GGZ Community supports loading <i>PGN</i> files.

<br/>

The GGZBoard games Hnefatafl, Checkers, Ludo and Arimaa all use the same
network protocol named <i>Bogaprot</i> (generic board game protocol), which
might be adapted by other games, too.
