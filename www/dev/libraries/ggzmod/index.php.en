<i>Description</i><br/>

With the help of ggzmod, game authors can use GGZ in their game clients. The library provides a state engine
and an event dispatcher. The states can be for instance CREATED (right after game startup), PLAYING (in the
middle of the game) or DONE (after the game has finished). Events include STATE (to inform about a new state),
SERVER (to inform the game client about the connection to the game server), PLAYER (if a player or bot joins
or leaves), SPECTATOR_SEAT (if a spectator joins or leaves), CHAT (if a table message is sent from one of the
game participants), and STATS (if the statistics of a player change).
The game host, aka the initiating player, can kick other players or replace them with bots using ggzmod
functions.
Note that there is a counterpart to ggzmod which is called ggzmod-ggz. It is attached to the ggzcore library
and used by GGZ core clients.
The ggzmod library depends on libggz.
<br/><br/>

As a special convenience for game client authors using the
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> toolkit, pyggzmod provides a pygame overlay adapter which
integrates perfectly with the pygame mainloop.

<i>More information</i><br/>
You might want to start with the API documentation for
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/api/ggzmod/">ggzmod</a> (C games)
or the one for
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/api/pyggzmod/">pyggzmod</a> (Python games).
Examples of usage include most game clients in the packages ggz-kde-games, ggz-gtk-games,
ggz-sdl-games and ggz-python.
It is however also used in tttxt (part of ggz-txt-client) and the guru games (part of ggz-grubby).
The communication protocol between ggzmod and ggzcore-ggz is standardized in the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/design/clientspec/clientspec-html/">client-client specification</a>.
Recommended documentation includes the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/modules/">Game Modules</a> document and the list of
features that GGZ provides, in the <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/ggzfeatures.html">GGZ Features</a>
document.
