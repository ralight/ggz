<i>Description</i><br>

There are different groups of functions in libggz. The first such group is memory handling, which
offers functions such as ggz_strdup() or ggz_malloc(), which resemble their counterparts from libc
but are more convenient to use. For instance, ggz_strdup(NULL) returns NULL instead of crashing,
and ggz_malloc() includes a reference counter to be used for debugging in combination with ggz_free().
The second group is configuration file management. A handle is retrieved with ggz_conf_parse(),
and is then subsequently used for reading and writing configuration values, including lists. This
leads to the group of data structure functions. Not only list creation and traversal, but also stacks
and XML helper functions (to be used with an XML library) are included. Another group are debug
functions which allow switching on and off debug messages for a certain tag. Another important group
for game development are the networking functions, historically known as the easysock library.
They permit the creation of server or client sockets, compatible with IPv6, as well as reading and
writing basic datatypes such as integers or strings. The last group are security functions, for both
cryptographic hash creation and comparison (using the gcrypt library), and for TLS encryption for
network channels using either GnuPG or OpenSSL.
