<i>Description</i><br/>

Similar to how the ggzmod library works for game clients, the ggzdmod library provides a state machine
and an event dispatcher. However neither of those are identical. The events include JOIN/LEAVE/SEAT
whenever a player or bot joins or leaves or is kicked by the game host, SPECTATOR_JOIN and so on for
joining and leaving game spectators, and PLAYER_DATA and SPECTATOR_DATA for input from the game clients.
The library offers functions such as counting the number of open or occupied seats on the current game table,
transmitting a game result with highscores, rankings or player ratings back to ggzd, registration of a
game log (for game continuation) or savegame file, and request methods to change the number of seats,
replace players with bots and vice-versa, or boot offending players.
The ggzdmod library depends on libggz.

<i>More information</i><br/>
You might want to start with the <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/api/ggzdmod/">API documentation</a>.
Examples of usage include more or less all game servers which are part of the ggz-server package,
but also those which are part of the python package.
The communication protocol between ggzdmod and the GGZ server ggzd is standardized in the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/design/serverspec/serverspec-html/">server-server specification</a>.
Recommended documentation includes the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/modules/">Game Modules</a> document and the list of
features that GGZ provides, in the <a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/ggzfeatures.html">GGZ Features</a>
document.
