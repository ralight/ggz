<b>GGZ @ Google Summer of Code 2008</b><br/>
GGZ will offer mentoring for several tasks during the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code 2008</a>
program.
Several ideas have been discussed and proposed for inclusion into
the program by GGZ developers. Other ideas can be proposed, there are
several mentors mentors available from GGZ and related projects.
You could join us on #ggz on freenode.net to find out about what's currently
on the TODO list. Several game developers for example have asked us for
help with multiplayer support, and we certainly cannot help all of them
at once even if we wanted to.
<br/><br/>

<b>About GGZ</b><br/>
First and foremost, a few words for those who don't know GGZ yet but are
desperate to achieve progress in the world of internet games:
GGZ aims to unify technical work needed to get decent and diverse online
gaming features into today's games. GGZ powers your favourite desktop games
on GNOME and KDE, and is also used by several other game projects.
In addition to game-related work on protocols, networking libraries and such,
the desktop and web integration aspects such as OpenID, web services and
instant messaging clients are very important to the project's future.
These goals are reflected in the tasks which you can find below.
<br/><br/>

<!--
<i>Improving the GGZ-Java package</i>
<br/>
Core task: GGZ-Java is the primary GGZ package used as an applet by players 
migrating from existing Windows-centric gaming sites. It is currently 
offering several cards games which can be played against the corresponding 
desktop versions of the games, and against each other. Since GGZ-Java is a 
new but promising package, some polishing is needed to establish it as the 
premier free gaming applet. Requirements gathered from the players, such as 
better administrative/hosting facilities, should be fulfilled together with 
the other GGZ developers. More games are being requested constantly by the 
players. A Texas Hold'em game could be implemented to demonstrate the power 
of the GGZ platform for game development and the GGZ-Java framework in 
particular.
<br/>
Optional subtasks (just notes):
<ul>
<li>help out Fink maintainer to integrate GGZ(-Java) on OSX better</li>
<li>integration with existing GGZ core clients for cc-game interoperability</li>
<li>even more games, in particular board games</li>
</ul>

<i>GGZ web service interfaces</i>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.ggzcommunity.org">GGZ-Community</a> is the
website which allows players to log into a  customised gaming portal, which
contains access to the GGZ database, in  particular to the list of players,
games and statistics. Furthermore, it can be used to schedule tournaments,
assign player karma and manage teams. 
An experimental <a href="http://api.ggzcommunity.org/">web service API</a>
exists which allows the development of special-purpose clients for player
management, statistics building and integration with dedicated communities.
The API is implemented as a REST interface in PHP but is far from being
complete, to improve this is the first task. The second task is to finish
(or redesign) the integrated OpenID provider and consumer for seamless
authentication transitions between GGZ Community and GGZ desktop clients.

<i>Advanced multiplayer features in Freeciv</i>
<br/>
<a href="http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Freeciv</a> is probably the
most well-known game using GGZ for its multiplayer features. However, there
are some limitations at the moment of how to handle joining and leaving
players, and how to handle dynamically-sized games. Such small issues could be
seen as a starting point to then add top-notch features to Freeciv's multiplayer
mode. The programming language would be mostly C.

<i>GGZ on KDE 4.2: Online game selector</i>
<br/>
<a href="http://metacle.ggzgamingzone.org/">Metacle</a> is a Python-based
meta-meta-server which aggregates real time statistics from currently played
games of various types. It does so by querying the appropriate meta servers
and makes the aggregated lists available through a bandwidth-preserving method
including delta transmission and push-style notifications.
There needs to be a desktop client for Metacle which uses freedesktop.org's
XDG standards to query locally installed game clients and offer users to
launch new games or join running games independent of their type. Of course
a majority of those will be GGZ-enabled, but some will not. An experimental
client in was written in PyKDE to get started, but the task would be to write
a client from scratch which can be shipped with KDE 4.2 if it turns out to
be a great tool. Both Python and C++ would be the best choices for this
task.

<i>New Game Client</i>
<br/>
As GGZ aims to provide the means for any open source game to add network
support, any new game clients would be well received. This is an open ended
task with the possibility of either extending an existing game to provide GGZ
support (a good example would be GNU Backgammon), or else write a new client
from scratch.<br/>
Although writing a new client is more involved than extending an existing one
in many ways, it does offer the advantage of greater flexibility because it can
be written in one of any of the languages we currently use (C, C++, Java,
Python, Ruby) and for any one of the toolkits (KDE, Gnome, Gtk, SDL).<br/>
In both cases there are essentially three tasks:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Define a protocol for the game.</li>
<li>Create the server program.</li>
<li>Create/extend the client program.</li>
</ol>
Depending on the game chosen, some of these tasks may be already completed. 
Looking at backgammon again, it would make sense to look at the FIBS protocol 
for example.<br/>
