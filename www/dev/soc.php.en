<b>Google Summer of Code 2007</b><br/>
GGZ will offer mentoring several tasks during the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code 2007</a> program.
Several ideas have been discussed and proposed for inclusion into
the program by GGZ developers.
<br/><br/>

<i>Improving the GGZ-Java package</i>
Core task: GGZ-Java is the primary GGZ package used as an applet by players 
migrating from existing Windows-centric gaming sites. It is currently 
offering several cards games which can be played against the corresponding 
desktop versions of the games, and against each other. Since GGZ-Java is a 
new but promising package, some polishing is needed to establish it as the 
premier free gaming applet. Requirements gathered from the players, such as 
better administrative/hosting facilities, should be fulfilled together with 
the other GGZ developers. More games are being requested constantly by the 
players. A Texas Hold'em game could be implemented to demonstrate the power 
of the GGZ platform for game development and the GGZ-Java framework in 
particular.
<br/>
Optional subtasks (just notes):
<ul>
<li>help out Fink maintainer to integrate GGZ(-Java) on OSX better</li>
<li>integration with existing GGZ core clients for cc-game interoperability</li>
<li>even more games, in particular board games</li>
</ul>
Mentor: Helg Bredow, Roger Light<br/>
<br/><br/>

<i>Community portal extensions</i>
Core task: GGZ-Community is the website which allows players to log into a 
customised gaming portal, which contains access to the GGZ database, in 
particular to the list of players, games and statistics. Furthermore, it can 
be used to schedule tournaments, assign player karma and manage teams. 
Especially the latter tasks are currently working insufficiently, and would 
show a high potential of attracting new players on the internet when 
implemented and integrated properly. New modules such as player and server 
administration are needed as well, which are currently partly available as 
external source code.
<br/>
Optional subtasks (just notes):
<ul>
<li>a good default theme (if artistic skills present)</li>
<li>better integration with blogs, forums, news sites, CMS</li>
</ul>
Mentor: Roger Light, Josef Spillner<br/>
<br/><br/>

<i>Desktop integration</i>
Core task: GGZ is currently being integrated with the major free Linux/Unix 
desktops (KDE and GNOME). A lot of games exist which currently do not have 
any multiplayer capabilities, even though GGZ provides servers for their 
kind, or implement protocols which do not talk to each other. In order to 
allow for a pervasive online gaming environment on any default Linux desktop 
games installation, the task would be to integrate GGZ into more games and to 
look at how to make network games easier to use for the average user.
<br/>
Optional subtasks (just notes):
<ul>
<li>better server connection dialogs</li>
<li>a control panel for those who want to safely run ggzd without knowing what a 
server is (as is known from Apache)</li>
</ul>
