<b>Statistics about GGZ</b><br/>
<br/><br/>

The first set of graphs is about our players online at live.ggzgamingzone.org.
One can see the daily spikes and the use of both registered and anonymous
logins, but also resource requirements such as bandwidth and memory.

The second set of graphs relates to GGZ development.
There's a nice graph showing the mean developer engagement which is probably hard to understand.
GGZ developer count at the development channel #ggz is tracked
<a href="http://atchoo.org/irssi/show.php?what=users&amp;type=channel&amp;value=ggz">here</a>
(see one-year graph below). Finally, our
<a href="http://mail.ggzgamingzone.org/">mail server</a> also provides some graphs
about the volume of sent mails to our lists.
