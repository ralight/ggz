<b>GGZ Technology</b><br>
Beside game development, a lot of extra sources happen to be created in a project
such as GGZ. On this page the developer tools are presented.
Other game projects can make use of them even when not having integrated GGZ!

<i>Game development libraries</i><br>

Our <a href="/libraries/">libraries</a> are available in C, C++ and Python and cover
general networking tasks, multiplayer support for other games and interfacing the
login and player system which sits at the heart of GGZ.
<br><br>

<i>Game frameworks</i><br>

Card games and board game development is a lot easier when using an existing framework
to be able to concentrate on the game logic, protocol and AI players.
GGZCards and GGZBoard are providing such a framework, respectively.
<br><br>

<i>Get Hot New Stuff integration</i><br>

Sharing levels, themes, savegames or avatars among players has never been easier.
With client implementations for SDL and KDE, this framework allows to upload
and download data of all kind, including ratings, a download counter and more.
Have a look at the official <a href="http://ghns.freedesktop.org/">GHNS homepage</a>
for more details.
<br><br>

<i>Communication Protocol Compiler (ggzcommgen)</i><br>

Works like with an IDL compiler, albeit with extended functionality:
From a single XML protocol specification, source code is generated automatically
for client and/or server, using one out of several available programming languages
and socket-level networking toolkits.
<br><br>

<i>Command-line wrappers</i><br>

There is a wrapper for core client functionality, called ggz-wrapper, which allows
external programs like IM clients to launch GGZ games of a certain type.
Another wrapper, ggzwrap, transparently forwards game client communication read
on/written to stdout, making it suitable for games which communicate this way
and enabling the usage of Java clients. For KDE, the graphical equivalent
ShadowBridge exists.
<br><br>

<i>Metaserver</i><br>

The GGZ metaserver is a generic data server with both XML and URI protocol support.
It allows for data storage, incremental synchronization, authentication and peer
updates.
