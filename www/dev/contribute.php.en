<b>How to contribute</b><br>
Due to the nature of GGZ, many small and sometimes completely unrelated tasks are 
waiting to be worked on.
<br>

<table class="inner">

<td valign="top" colspan="2">

<i>Play</i><br>
One clear advantage of game project is that having fun can already help a lot,
if bugs or bogus game situations are reported to the GGZ bug tracker.

<br><br>

<i>Translate</i><br>
Most of our applications and games are internationalized, as are the web pages.
Maintenance and new translations are always needed.
Have a look at our <a href="i18n/">internationalization page</a>.

<br><br>

<i>Add multimedia</i><br>
Graphically, most of our games need improvements. Sounds are currently not used
at all. Levels and storylines could be added to some games as well.
Go to the <a href="art/">artwork page</a>.

<br><br>

<i>Develop plugins</i><br>
Our chatbot can load plugins dynamically for all sorts of communication.
Details can be found in grubby's doc/ directory.
The GGZ server uses a well-defined interface for database access,
backends for it exist for various formats.

<br><br>

<i>Develop games</i><br>
The GGZ Game Development Guide and other documents help in how to create new
game servers and clients in C, C++ and Python, using toolkits such as
SDL, KDE/Qt or Gtk+.

<br><br>

<i>Hack GGZ</i><br>
Since the entire GGZ system is open, everything from server enhancements to
new programming languages can be discussed on the ggz-dev mailing list.

<br><br>

<i>Administration</i><br>
Running GGZ servers or mirroring web pages and FTP contents are helping the
project as well.
