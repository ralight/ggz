<b>AI player and algorithm development</b><br>
AI players are a standard feature of most GGZ games. Sometimes, they're available
on the game client to allow for local games against the computer without depending
on a network connection, but in most cases, AI players reside in the game server.
Some AIs run as part of the server, while others run as external processes and are
only managed by the game server.
This page gives an overview about current AI players, their strengths and so on.

All the other games which provide AI players have them included (and hardcoded)
internally.
The following game clients beside the ones mentioned above support AI players, so that
they can be played locally against the computer:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/ggzboard/">GGZBoard</a> (for Ludo),
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/ktictactux/">KTicTacTux</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/fyrdman/">Fyrdman</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/kcc/">KCC</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/muehle/">Muehle</a> (external perl script),
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/geekgame/">Geekgame</a>
<br>
The following game clients provide some dummy AI players mostly based on random decisions
so that they at least appear to be playable:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/escape-sdl/">Escape/SDL</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/cchess/">Xadrez ChinÃªs</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/games/ggzboard/">GGZBoard</a>
(for ConnectX, Hnefatafl, Checkers, Reversi)

<br><br>
Note that GGZBoard-Ludo is a dummy AI too but it plays really well for it.

<i>Contributing AI players</i><br>
We'd like to offer good (specialised) AI players to our users. If someone develops
an AI, it can for sure be integrated with GGZ. Most of the time, GGZ itself can only
offer "just good enough" algorithms for the casual players, but we'd certainly like
to see game geeks being attracted as well.
The feature of Named Bots makes it possible for players to select against which
kind of AI they want to play!
