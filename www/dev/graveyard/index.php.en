<b>GGZ Graveyard</b><br/>
Games and applications which fall apart after being unmaintained for some time
are removed from the SVN trunk and put into the graveyard, that is, there is
some virtual commemoration for them.
<br/><br/>

If you want to help reviving one of the games, feel free to contact the
GGZ developers!
