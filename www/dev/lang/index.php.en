<b>GGZ for the language enthusiasts</b><br/>
Over time, the development within GGZ changed from pure C programming towards
a more versatile model where each domain is covered by a specific programming
language. Nowadays six main languages are being used in significant parts
of the project, with a few others being present but not used much.
These top languages appear to be C (60%), C++ (20%), Java (10%),
Python (6%), PHP (3%) and Ruby (&lt; 1 %). Remember that those numbes are
hard to compare with each other. A <a href="ggz-sloc-lin.png">comparison graph</a>
for the SLOC has been produced.
<br/><br/>

The links above will lead straight to the programming language information
pages.
