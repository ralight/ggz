<b>GGZ Developers</b><br/>
The following people are currently working on improving GGZ and produce game
after game. Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/releases/latest/credits.php">release credits page</a>
for a full listing of people who contributed to the project.
<br/><br/>

Some of the developers are also too shy to appear here.
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/backend/grubby/">Grubby</a> knows
everything about them though - ask him!
<br/><br/>

<i>Josef Spillner</i><br/>
Long-time student from Germany. Can't tell Spades from Bridge but pretends to
be the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe killer player.
Hacks mostly on GGZ Python these days, and cares more about version interface
numbers than about readable web pages (hah!).
