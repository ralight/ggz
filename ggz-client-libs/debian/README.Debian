ggz-client-libs for Debian
----------------------

Although not fully compliant with Debian concepts, it is currently the best
solution to include the ggz-config binary as well as the ggzcore library and
headers here.

Please note that the C++ frontend for ggzcore is currently in the package
ggz-kde-client.
