=============================================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - Core Client Libraries - Snapshot 0.99.3
=============================================================

GGZ Gaming Zone core client libraries provides the common procedures
and utilities required to run the GGZ client and games.  The routines
are shared by other modules in order to ease coding and promote
compatibility and stability.

This version of the client libraries (0.0.14) should provide
compatibility with version 0.0.14 clients and servers.

The core client libraries is only one part of the GGZ Gaming Zone
client setup.  The following additional packages are required:
  * libggz - provides commonly used functions and low-level
    communications between client modules and the GGZ servers
  * gtk-client/kde-client - one or more of the GGZ clients will be
    required in order to login to a server, chat and launch games
  * gtk-games/kde-games/sdl-games - one or more games or game packs
    are required in order to launch and play games

The order in which these components are compiled and installed is very
important.  See the README.GGZ file for complete information on
compiling the GGZ client system.

If you encounter any bugs or have difficulty compiling, please report bugs
via the bug tracker on our SourceForge project page, or send an email to the
developer's mailing list.
