.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
The program \fBggz-config\fR is a central tool and part of the
client libraries package of the GGZ Gaming Zone.
It can be used for several purposes.  Primarily
it is used to maintain the \fIggz.modules\fP configuration
file by installing and removing game module information.
This is done with the \fI\-\-install\fP and \fI\-\-remove\fP
modes of operation.
.LP 
Additionally, the program can query the installation settings
of the GGZ client libraries to assist in configuring the
build process of a client or game module.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
Query Mode Options
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-configdir\fR
Output location of the GGZ client libraries configuration
directory and exit. This value will usually be \fI@ggzconfdir@\fR
and is where the file \fIggz.modules\fR is located.
.TP 
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gamedir\fR
Output location of the executable game modules and exit.
Game modules in this directory are all game clients which are not
installed into a standard PATH directory, mostly because they only
run when invoked by a GGZ core client. As a special module, the
game client wrapper \fBggzwrap\fR is installed into this place.
The gamedir is usually \fI@ggzexecmoddir@\fR.
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-datadir\fR
Output location of game module data directory and exit.
This is where games look for their graphics and level data.
This will likely resolve to \fI@ggzdatadir@\fR.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-protocol\fR
Query GGZ_CS_PROTO_VERSION - version of core protocol between the
GGZ server and any GGZ core clients.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Output help information and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-usage\fR
Print some \fBggz-config\fR usage scenarios for quick reference.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit.
.LP 
Install Mode Options
.TP 
\fB\-\-install\fR
Specifies that we are installing a game module description.
.TP 
\fB\-\-modfile=\fR\fIFILENAME\fP
Specifies the source module description file.
\fIFILENAME\fR will often be named module.dsc, but this is merely
a convention.
.TP 
\fB\-\-force\fR
Overwrite an existing module entry of the same name, author
and version rather than returning an error.
.TP 
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-destdir\fR
Specifies that the \fI$DESTDIR\fP environment variable
contains a directory to prepend to the path for the GGZ
module configuration file (\fIggz.modules\fP).  The
only known purpose for this is for creating binary packages
of GGZ games.
.LP 
Uninstall Mode Options
.TP 
\fB\-\-remove\fR
Specifies that we are removing a game module description.
.TP 
\fB\-\-modfile=\fR\fIFILENAME\fP
Specifies the source module description file.
.SH "FILES"
.TP 
\fI@ggzconfdir@/ggz.modules\fP
Game module registry for all GGZ Gaming Zone core clients.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.LP 
.TP 
\fBDESTDIR\fR
Used during install process, most commonly by the
build sequence of binary packages such as \fBrpm\fR or
\fBdpkg\fR.
.SH "BUGS"
.LP 
The program is currently unable to detect many problems
that could arise with an invalid \fIggz.modules\fP file.
.LP 
Probably others, too numerous to mention.
