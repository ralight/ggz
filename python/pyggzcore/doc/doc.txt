How to use pyggzcore
--------------------

1) Use the ggzcore documentation!
   While pyggzcore does have some simplifications, the basic
   concepts are still the same like in the C version.

2) Objects
   The GGZServer object has already been created when running any
   script which imports ggzcore. It is thus accessible as in:
     s = ggzcore.server
   The room and game objects are at this time None objects, until they
   are assigned their proper values.

3) Handlers
   Unlike in the C version, handlers are not set on a object basis, but
   on a object class basis. This means that calling
     ggzcore.setHandler(ggzcore.EVENT_ROOM, room_event)
   can be done once at the beginning, and is then valid for all room objects.

4) Structures
   In C, a lot of structures and arrays are used to combine values.
   In python, those are translated as follows:
     SERVER MOTD_LOADED: array of char* -> string with line breaks
     SERVER_ROOM_LIST: (nothing) -> list of room names
     ROOM_CHAT_EVENT: GGZChatEventData* -> list with (type, sender, message)

5) Identifiers
   While internally rooms, players etc. still have numbers, the API enforces
   referring them by their respective names.

6) Memory handling
   The way pyggzcore is designed, an application author should never have to
   worry about memory allocations.
