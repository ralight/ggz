Installing the GGZ python packages
==================================

This is somewhat different from how C/C++ packages work.
First of all, while autoconf is used, automake is not - the python
distutils are used instead for some parts of ggz-python.

A standard installation procedure would be:

# Run autoconf etc. if configure does not exist yet (i.e. SVN checkout)
./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/ggz/build
# Configure package, to be installed to where the other GGZ packages reside
./configure --prefix=/home/ggz/build
# Compilation of python wrapper modules
make
# Installation
make install

Afterwards, the variable PYTHONPATH must point to this directory
unless it's already in Python's default search path. In most cases it's not
even necessary to set it anymore, but if it is then set the following:

export PYTHONPATH=/home/ggz/build/lib/python2.5/site-packages

That's it, basically.
