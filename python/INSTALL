Installing the GGZ python packages
==================================

This is somewhat different from how C/C++ packages work.
First of all, while autoconf is used, automake is not - the python
distutils are used instead.

A standard installation procedure would be:

# Run autoconf if configure does not exist yet (i.e. CVS checkout)
autoconf
# Configure package, to be installed to where the other GGZ packages reside
./configure --prefix=/home/ggz/build
# Compilation of python wrapper modules
make
# Installation
make install prefix=/home/ggz/build

Afterwards, the variable PYTHONPATH must point to this directory
unless it's already in Python's default search path.

export PYTHONPATH=/home/ggz/build/lib/site-python:/home/ggz/build/lib/python2.3/site-packages

That's it, basically.
