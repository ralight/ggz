For people not liking C or C++, the GGZ Python package provides
everything they need to start hacking on GGZ.
This package has appeared first as part of GGZ 0.0.8.
Players will love the elegance and flexibility of games written in
a scripting language.

Content of GGZ-Python:
	- PyGGZMod, python wrapper for the ggzmod library (game clients)
	- PyGGZdMod, python wrapper for the ggzdmod library (game servers)
	- PyGGZCore, simplified python wrapper for ggzcore (core clients)
	- Dresden, a simple single-player pygame-based game
	- Escape/SDL, port of the Windows game Escape to pygame + ggz-python,
	  which also works in single-player mode against the AI
	- Xadrez Chines, a chinese chess game client, server and AI module
	- Vibora, fullscreen core client

All of them have their own README for more information on them.
