Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.8!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players
(quite a few game support statistics now).

Features in this release:

- Overhauled project website, integrating player rankings and game information
- Python package as an alternative to C/C++ game development
- Chatbot game support and other enhancements
- New game clients: KCC (Chinese Checkers), Escape/SDL (Escape)
- New game server: Tuxman

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with the
GGZ client.
