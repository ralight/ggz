Protocol used by Xadrez Chines
==============================

- client and server assume the same board setup (for now)

- server sends move request
  "your turn"
- client sends move
  "move from 3,4 to 7,5"
- server sends response
  "move was ok"
  "move was invalid"
  "not your turn"
- server broadcasts move
  "opponent moved from 3,4 to 7,5"

- game events can happen too
  "opponent took figure at 7,5 from you"

- server sends game result
  "opponent won"
