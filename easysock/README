The GGZ Gaming Zone - Easysock Library
======================================

The GGZ Gaming Zone easysock library provides a simple low-level API
for synchronous communication over TCP and Unix domain sockets.  The
GGZ Project uses easysock extensively for both client/server and game
module communication.  This version of the easysock library (0.3.0)
should provide compatibility with version 0.0.4 clients and version
0.0.3-0.0.4 servers.  

For more information on GGZ, and to download easysock source and
packages, see http://ggz.sourceforge.net.  For instructions on
installing and compiling the easysock library, see the INSTALL file
included with the easysock sources.

To create a socket with easysock, simply call es_make_socket() or
es_make_unix_socket() for TCP or Unix domain sockets respectively.
Once a connection has been established, there are four function groups
for reading and writing four types of data : single-byte characters,
integers, strings, and file descriptors (note that file descriptors
can only be passed over Unix domain sockets).  These functions are all
of the form 

es_<operation>_<datatype>()

where <operation> is either read or write, and <datatype> is one of
char, int, string, or fd.  There are other function variants as well.
These are all documented in the header file easysock.h


If you encounter any bugs or have difficulty compiling, please report bugs
via the bug tracker on our SourceForge project page, or send an email to the
developer's mailing list.
