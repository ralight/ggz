Announcing the release of libeasysock-0.3.0!

The easysock library provides a simple low-level API for synchronous
communication over TCP and Unix domain sockets.  It should compile and
install on any Unix or Unix-like system.  We have successfully tested
it on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.

This is the first public release of the code for easysock.  Its API is
still under development, but the code is quite usable.
