- Make thread safe:
  Either error and exit funcs need to go in thread specific area...
  Or we do things on a per-socket basis and let the app worry about it :)

- Add IPv6 support:
  Need to incorporate Riq's patch

- Rename es_make_socket() to es_make_tcp_socket()

- UDP Support?

- Non-blocking support?

- Document error and exit functions

- Document alloc functions
