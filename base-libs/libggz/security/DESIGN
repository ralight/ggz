libggz offers some functions to make working with TLS-encrypted connections
easier. Native TLS libraries are abstracted from because their availability
differs a lot. The abstraction is probably not without flaws, however for the
given purpose, namely to sufficiently secure players from snoopers, it should
fulfil its purpose.

These are the current implementations of libggz's TLS library wrappers.
Only one wrapper can be used, and needs to be compiled into libggz.

none.c:
	Dummy wrapper for read/write calls. This implementation does therefore not
	support encryption, nor authentication.

gnutls.c:
	GNUTLS support. It provides encryption via DHA, but no authentication
	either.

openssl.c:
	OpenSSL doesn't support anon-DH, so a certificate and private key are
	_essential_. However, both are not really examined, so the statement
	encryption yes, authentication no applies here as well.

nss.c:
	Netscape Security Services. Currently provides encryption via DHA, although
	certificate and key should allow for other algorithms. No authentication
	at the moment.
