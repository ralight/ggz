These are the current implementations of libgensecure.

none.c:
	Dummy wrapper for read/write calls. This implementation does therefore not
	support encryption, nor authentication.

gnutls.c:
	GNUTLS support. It provides encryption via DHA, but no authentication
	either.

openssl.c:
	OpenSSL doesn't support anon-DH, so a certificate and private key are
	_essential_. However, both are not really examined, so the statement
	encryption yes, authentication no applies here as well.
