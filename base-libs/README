======================================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - Base Libraries - Snapshot 0.99.5
======================================================

This package contains the GGZ Gaming Zone base libraries.
The libraries provide the common procedures and utilities required to run
the GGZ clients and games. The routines are shared by other packages in
order to ease coding and promote compatibility and stability.

The following libraries and tools are included:

* libggz, containing many convenience functions for C programming. It is used
  by the GGZ Gaming Zone server (ggzd), the other libraries in this package,
  as well as some clients and games.
* ggzcore, the core client library which implements the client side of the
  main GGZ server to client protocol.
* ggzmod, the game client library which implements the game side of the
  GGZ core client to game client protocol; as well as ggzmod-ggz, the
  internal static library which implements the core client side of the
  same protocol.
* ggz-config, a configuration tool for GGZ installations.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
For an overall view on the GGZ setup procedures, please consult the
file README.GGZ
