NetGames
=========

Welcome to NetGames, a multiuser networked gaming environment.  This project
is still in the development phase, and as such is not generally playable.
If you are interested in assisting with development, or in writing server
modules for you favorite game, please let me know.

At this moment, the server only supports one type of game (spades), and
users can only login anonymously.  In fact the client is simply a hack of my
NetSpades client.  I am releasing this only so that people can look at the
server architecture and play with it.  Everything is subject to change.

Compiling
=========
You need to have popt, libtool, autoconf, automake, pthreads, and gtk
installed in order to compile NetGames.  Most developers have these, or at
least are capable of installing these.  I will probably not make a binary
release unless people really press me.  After unpacking the tarball, you
should be able to compile NetGames via the following:

cd NetGames; ./autogen.sh; make

Running
=======
The server is named netgamed and will be created in NetGames/server.  You
must run it from that dir since the path to the spades server is hardcoded.
When you run it, you *must* specify a port number with the -p option.

The client is named gnetgames and will be in NetGames/gtkclient.  Remember
that only anonymous logins work, and the only game operations which work are
launching and joining.

Please let me know if you have any problems, comments, feedback. etc.


Enjoy!
