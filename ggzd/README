The Gnu Gaming Zone
===================

Welcome to the Gnu Gaming Zone, a multiuser networked gaming
environment.  This project is still in the development phase, and as
such may have some bugs.  It may not even compile or run (although we
do our best to make sure it does).  If you are interested in assisting
with development or in writing server modules for you favorite game,
please let us know at ggz-dev@lists.sourceforge.net

At this moment, the server supports two game types: spades, and
tic-tac-toe.  Players can still only login anonymously.  We are
releasing this so that people can look at the server architecture and
play with it.  Everything is subject to change.


Downloading
===========
You can always download the latest released version of GGZ from our
homepage at http://ggz.sourceforge.net, or for the absolute bleeding
edge you can check out the sources via anonymous CVS (instructions are
at the aforementioned homepage).  You should be aware that the client
and the server are distributed separately.  The server is distributed
as ggz_server-X.X.X.tar.gz and the client as ggz_client-X.X.X.tar.gz
where X.X.X is the version number.  

Prior to the 1.0.0 release you can expect that backwards-compatibility
with previous versions *will be broken* so please make sure you are
using matching versions of client and server.


Compiling and Installing
========================
You need to have popt, pthreads, and gtk installed in order to compile
GGZ.  Most developers have these, or at least are capable of
installing these.  Assuming you are unpacking the sources in a
directory named ~/sources, you can compile the server with the
following:


cd ~/sources/ggz_server-X.X.X; configure; make

and similarly for the client:

cd ~/sources/ggz_client-X.X.X; configure; make

where X.X.X is the version number.

If you wish to install the client and server you can do a 'make
install' in each of the source directories at this point.

For more detailed instructions on comfiguring and installing the
client and server, please read the INSTALL file in each of the
respective source directories.


Running
=======
You must have access to a running server for the client to be of any
use to you.  The server does not have to be running on your machine,
but we expect that until someone volunteers to run a production server
full-time, you'll probably be running both the client and ther server
locally.

If you have already installed the client and server, you may start the
server simply be running the command 'ggzd' This will start the server
listening on port of 5688.  Similarly, you may run the client with the
command 'ggz'

If you would like to test the software before installing it, please
use the following steps:  

- execute a 'make test' in the ggz-server top level source directory
- run the server with the command 'ggzd/ggzd -f ggzd/ggzd.test'
- change to the ggz-client source and run the client with the command 
  'ggz/ggz -f ggzrc.test'


Bugs
