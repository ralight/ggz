The GGZ Gaming Zone - GGZ Server and Game Servers - Snapshot 0.99.3
===================================================================

This package ("ggz-server") contains the main GGZ server, some
administrative utilities, a game server handling library and lots
of game servers.

Content of ggz-server:
	- ggzd, the main multi-threaded multi-process server with support
		for database backends, LAN/metaserver integration and more
	- ggzduedit, an admin tool to handle the user management of ggzd
	- ggzdmod, a library to make game server development easier, which
		interfaces directly with ggzd
	- ggzdmod++, a C++ variant of ggzdmod (which itself is written in C)
	- game servers, plenty of servers which are all compiled by default,
		18 servers right now with support for statistics, savegames,
		game spectators, AI bots, and more!

For a full server installation, it is recommended to add some more packages
from GGZ and other projects. Please refer to the GGZ Hosting Guide for more
information, which can be found in the ggz-docs package.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.
For an overall view on the GGZ setup procedures, please consult the file
