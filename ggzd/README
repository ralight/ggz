The GGZ Gaming Zone
===================

Welcome to the GGZ Gaming Zone, a multiuser networked gaming
environment.  This project is still in the development phase, and as
such may have some bugs.  It may not even compile or run (although we
do our best to make sure it does).  If you are interested in assisting
with development or in writing server modules for you favorite game,
please let us know at ggz-dev@mail.ggzgamingzone.org.


Downloading
===========
You can always download the latest released version of GGZ from our
homepage at http://ggzgamingzone.org/, or for the absolute bleeding
edge you can check out the sources via anonymous CVS (instructions are
at the aforementioned homepage).  You should be aware that the client
and the server are distributed separately.  Please see README.GGZ for
more details on the other parts of GGZ.

Prior to the 1.0.0 release you can expect that backwards-compatibility
with previous versions *will be broken* so please make sure you are
using matching versions of client and server.


Compiling and Installing
========================
Before you compile the GGZ server you must have the following
installed on your system:
 
 - pthreads (comes with most C libraries)
 - popt -> is no longer needed from GGZ 0.0.11 on!
 - expat (from http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/expat/)
 - libdb2 or libdb3 (from http://www.sleepycat.com/update/3.2.9/)

Most developers have these, or at least are capable of installing
these.  Assuming you are unpacking the sources in a directory named
~/sources, you can compile the server with the following:

cd ~/sources/ggz_server-X.X.X; configure; make

For more detailed instructions on comfiguring and installing the
server, please read the INSTALL file.


Running
=======
If you have already installed the client and server, you may start the
server simply be running the command 'ggzd' This will start the server
listening on port of 5688.

If you would like to test the software before installing it, please
use the following steps:  

- execute a 'make test' in the ggz-server top level source directory
- run the server with the command './ggzd/ggzd -f ggzd/ggzd.test'
- Test with one of the GGZ clients


Bugs
====
Bugs in our code?  Never! :)  But if you do happen to find one, you
can report it at http://bugs.ggzgamingzone.org/ or feel

Please let us know if you have any problems, comments, feedback. etc.


Enjoy!
