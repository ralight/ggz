Everything!

Seriously though.  Here is my first go at a todo list.  As people suggest
ideas I will try to put them on the list.  As the code progresess I will
nail down more specific time frames.

Short run
=========
- chat facility
- better handing of end-of-game
- handle SIGCHLD
- list of currently playing games
- list of available game types


Medium run
==========
- list of logged in users
- user database
- another game type
- config file handling


Long run
========
- user statistics
- observers
