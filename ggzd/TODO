Things to be done on the GGZ server side
(larger tasks only, small bugs are on http://bugs.ggzgamingzone.org/):

GGZ server (ggzd)
-----------------
* configuration realod on signal
  (very difficult, and SIGUSR1/2 are already in use)
* usage of a real XML library to send out XML
  (expat can only parse - use libxml?)

Libraries (ggzdmod, ggzdmod++)
------------------------------
* (nothing in particular)

Game servers
------------
* unification of feature sets
  (spectators, leave/rejoin, statistics, savegames, ...)
