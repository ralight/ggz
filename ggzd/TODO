For 0.0.2
=========
- Update code to new opcode names
- Rename functions to match file and opcode names where appropriate
- Check mutex's. Expecially table.mutex
- Redo way table structure stores info about whos playing: this should be
simple and not have lots of redundant data like we do now: the array of fd's
and the array of names.  We need a few special (negative) fd values like
FD_OPEN, FD_COMP_PLAY, FD_RESERVED, and FD_NOSEAT. Then we can get rid of
num_players, num_humans, num_openseats, comp_mask, etc. and replace them
with functions (or macros) operating on this array.  (maybe num_players gets
to stay since it's important.  not sure)
- redo table launch so that game server is forked immediately and then
  players join later (pass fd's using sendmsg() )
- implement REQ_LEAVE_TABLE
- better handing of end-of-game
- if everyone leaves a table, remove it
- handle SIGCHLD for when game_servrs die
- implement player database (at least API)
- implement tic-tac-toe as simple game example
- config file handling

Medium run
==========
- rooms?
- multiple implementations of user database (SQL/libdb)
- implement rooms
- reservations

Long run
========
- user statistics
- observers
- re-write spades
