For 0.0.2
=========
- Plot out mutex nesting and make sure deadlock is impossible
- redo table launch so that game server is forked immediately and then
  players join later (pass fd's using sendmsg() )
- implement REQ_LEAVE_TABLE (depends on above item)
- rename some of the #define's (and do we need COMP_ALLOW?)
- s/comp/bot
- better handing of end-of-game
- if everyone leaves a table, remove it
- handle SIGCHLD for when game_servrs die
- implement player database (at least API)
- implement tic-tac-toe as simple game example
- Do we really need player.info[].playing?  Nothing uses it!

Medium run
