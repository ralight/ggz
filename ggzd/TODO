Things to be done on the GGZ server side
(larger tasks only, small bugs are on http://bugs.ggzgamingzone.org/):

GGZ server (ggzd)
-----------------
* configuration reload on signal
  (very difficult, and SIGUSR1/2 are already in use)
  (SIGHUP currently leads to graceful shutdown)
=> this is being worked on (reconfiguration monitoring with FAM/inotify)
* usage of a real XML library to send out XML
  (expat can only parse - use libxml?)
* connection upgrade to TLS at any time
  (like STARTTLS for SMTP or RFC 2817(?) for HTTP)
* database hashing type should be added to the user table
* support for dbus notifications (interesting for developers who will
  make use of ggzd on the desktop in combination with a control GUI)

Libraries (ggzdmod, ggzdmod++)
------------------------------
* (nothing in particular)

Game servers
------------
* unification of feature sets over all games
  (spectators, leave/rejoin, statistics, savegames, ...)
