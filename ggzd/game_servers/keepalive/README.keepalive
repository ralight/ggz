Keepalive - Experimental GGZ game
=================================

This game will have the following new features:
- 'permanent' game (will not end when all players have left)
- server-side data storage (TODO)
- realtime
- UDP communication (TODO)

It won't be a cute game but rather a proof of concept.
An example client exists for Qt 2.x.
