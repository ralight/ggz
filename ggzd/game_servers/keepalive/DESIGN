Here's the initial design of Keepalive, written down in text form.

A player can launch the game either directly (connecting to the Keepalive
server), or through GGZ.
She is then faced with a login screen, which requires username and password.
By typing in a new user name, it is registered with the specified password.
Later on it is then possible to log in using this combination.

After the registration or authorization, the player enters the game board.
She will see all other players, both active ones (named 'avatars' and displayed
as such) and inactive ones ('graves'). A third kind of player is 'born', which
indicates a player who joins for the first time and is not an avatar yet.
A fourth one will be 'spectator', but this is probably identical to 'born'.

Each avatar can run around on the earth, but there's nothing more to do
currently. When a player leaves a game, her avatar goes into the graveyard.
