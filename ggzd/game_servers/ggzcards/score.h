 *
 * Right now GGZCards uses a super-generic "messaging" system.  Text
 * messages are generated by the server and sent to the client for
 * direct display.  This makes i18n basically impossible.  It also
 * makes really cool client displays basically impossible.  However,
 * it makes it really easy to add new games - you don't even have to
 * change the client!
 *
 * A more complicated alternate messaging system is in planning.
