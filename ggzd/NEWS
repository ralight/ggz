Announcing the release of NetGames-0.0.1!

This is the first developers release of the code for NetGames.  It is meant
solely for feedback and information purposes.  It probably won't run
correctly, and may not even compile.  Most of the features are absent.

Then why release?  Because I'm holding to the Free Software guidline of
"Release Early.  Release Often." I'd like to get more eyeballs on the code
than just my own. Also, since NetGames is designed to be an infrastructure
for game developers to incorporate their games into, this gives them a
chance to looks things over.

For this first release, the important things to observer are in the main
NetGames server.  The basic architecture for handling players and game
tables is in place.  I have not done a large amount of client or game server
coding. Therefore, in order to test the NetGames server, I hacked my spades
client and server to work.  Please don't flame me too much for the messiness
:)

There is much more information about the server architecture in
README.Design.  It is a lengthy document, but it should answer many
questions about the way the NetGames server works (or will work).  There is
also an xfig sketch in server_arch.fig.  If you don't have xfig, a copy in
GIF format is available at my website.

So what can I do with it?  Other than looking at the code, you can play
spades with 1-4 players.  See the README file for more details.
