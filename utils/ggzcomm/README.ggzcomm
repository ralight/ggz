GGZComm - GGZ communication protocol generator
----------------------------------------------

GGZComm uses XML protocol descriptions (PDL files) to generate
source code for a variety of programming languages and networking
libraries in order to produce code which integrates the game network
protocol with the programming language in procedural or object-oriented
style.
PDL files are similar to IDL (interface description language) files, except
that server->client communication is part of it also, and it is generally
more friendly towards GGZ game developers.

The ggzcommgen executable is written in Ruby, so the interpreter is needed
for source code generation, however it's not needed for using the generated
source code.

Read DESIGN to find out about the initial design document, and
protocol-format.txt for an up-to-date format description.
Furthermore, read the protocols section in the GGZ documentation, which is
also available online at:

http://dev.ggzgamingzone.org/protocols/
http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/docs/games/protocols/

To generate the source code, you might start with the process which is
currently in use with the Tic-Tac-Toe game server:

./ggzcommgen -i easysock -l c -r server tictactoe

Here's a table of supported programming languages and libraries (the
parameters to --language and --interface, respectively):

Language | Library    | Status
============================================
C        | easysock   | in use (TTT server)
         | dio        | experimental
---------+------------+-------------
C++      | qt         | in use (kconnectx)?
         | mnet       | experimental
         | easysock   | -- (only in C)
         | dio        | -- (only in C)
         | qt4        | experimental
         | kggzraw    | experimental
         | kggzpacket | experimental
---------+------------+-------------
Python   | socket     | in use (examples)
---------+------------+-------------
Ruby     | socket     | experimental

Related projects worth a try if ggzcomm doesn't fit a game developer's need:
- all sorts of IDL compilers, especially:
- Apache Thrift
- Google Protocol Buffers
