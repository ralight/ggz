The GGZ Gaming Zone Meta Server Project
---------------------------------------

The meta server will be available for the 0.0.5 release.
However, other projects are free to use it. It consists of 'meta-server',
'minidom' and some GUI's for testing purposes (or as reference implementations).
It has no dependencies on any GGZ library, although it will be going to be
integrated into ggzd (and be available as a separate package in parallel).

The GUI's will have to be compiled separately, they're not part of the autoconf
process yet and will probably never be.

The server itself should be installed on port 15689 and be located in
/usr/local/bin (or change the path in metaserv.c).

/etc/services:
ggzm       15689/tcp            # GGZ Gaming Zone meta server
/etc/inetd.conf:
ggzm stream tcp nowait josef /usr/local/bin/metaserv
