Custom GUIs for the GGZ Meta Server
-----------------------------------

freeciv-index.php:

Create the well-known Freeciv meta server index page, as known from
http://www.freeciv.org/metaserver.
This requires PHP 4 with Expat and socket functions compiled in.

It does not work yet. Why?
- so far no information beside the URI is returned
- the metaserver would need realtime-updates, preferably by yet another wrapper
  (tm) which takes freeciv connection data, rewrites it into XML and passes it
  to a GGZ metaserver, without authentication (freeciv's metaserver is open to
  anonymous users).
