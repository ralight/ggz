The GGZ Gaming Zone meta server
-------------------------------

This component should be able to deal with two types of queries.
The first one is the simple case: one passes an URI, and it returns another URI
then.

	c->s: query://ggz/connection/0.0.5pre
	s->c: ggz://jzaun.com:5688

This implementation returns a NULL pointer if no entry could be found or the
URI didn't have a valid format.
For 0.0.5 all core clients should be able to deal with ggz:// URI's since
they're used in the chat, in the connection dialog, maybe in KDE io slaves
(GnomeVFS the same?) and (hopefully) on web pages.

For more complex queries, an extendable result set may be required. The format
for that is therefore XML. The advantage is that multiple entries are allowed
to be returned.

	c->s:	<?xml version="1.0"?>
			<query class="ggz" type="connection">
				0.0.5pre
			</query>
	s->c:	<?xml version="1.0"?>
			<resultset>
				<result preference="100">
					<uri>
						ggz://jzaun.com:5688
					</uri>
					<location>
						pennsylvania, us
					</location>
				</result>
			</resultset>

The meta server does automatically handle both cases. The configuration has
been moved from a ggzcore_confio format to an XML-based one, so one can pass
native DOM subtrees to the client.

The configuration file is metaservconf.xml.
Metaserv should be installed on port "ggzm" (15689), to be invoked by inetd.

In XML, an empty resultset is returned if no entries are found.
URI-based results are chosen by priority; the entry with the highest priority
is returned; among equals, one is randomly chosen.
