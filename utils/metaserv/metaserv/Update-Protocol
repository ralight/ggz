Keeping the meta server up to date
----------------------------------

Much time and source code will have to be invested in making the GGZ Gaming
Zone a distributed gaming environment.
As meta servers play an important role for decentralized structures, they will
have to be updated from time to time. Here's a proposal on how to automate
this.

Every meta server maintains (in metaserverconf.xml) a list of authorizations,
beside the actual URIs. All people listed with the 'update' capability can
submit updates. This does of course apply to servers as well once they're able
to do so.
Each autorization belongs to one realm (like 'ggz' or 'atlantik'), and only the
configuration section containing this realm can be updated.

	c->s:	<?xml version="1.0"?>
			<update class="ggz" type="connection" username="heinz" password="*******">
				<option name="mode">add</option>
				<option name="version">0.0.5pre</option>
				<option name="preference">50</option>
				<option name="uri">ggz://jzaun.com:5688</option>
			</update>
	s->c:	<?xml version="1.0"?>
			<resultset referer="update">
				<result>
					<status>accepted</status>
				</result>
			</resultset>

The following modes can be used:
add: add this entry to the list
modify: if such an entry exists, change some parts like the preference or version
delete: if such an entry exists, delete it

The following status codes can occur:

accepted: the update was completed successfully
rejected: authorization failed
wrong: wrong class/type/options
error: internal error like disk full

Please note that such a service must run permanently then to ensure that no
data is lost when multiple requests arrive at the same time. For testing
purpose we leave it at port 15689 spawned by inetd, however.

Only queries should be done using the URI method, updates require XML format.
It is _strongly_ recommended to use TLS encryption for the transmission of data
like usernames or passwords.
