I assume you are basically familiar with the concept of PKI
(Public Key Infrastructure). If you're not, don't worry,
this guide will hopefully lead to a proper configured environment.

1. Install OpenSSL and SSLeay. (http://www.openssl.org)
2. Make sure you've got the development files installed, too
   (normally under /usr/local/ssl/include/openssl).
3. Create a Certificate Authority (CA) self-signed certificate,
   and create a certificate request for your "server" (virtually),
   to be signed by the CA.
4. Install all files appropriately, maybe change the locations is
   src/configuration.h.
5. Compile, without installation. Run genserver and genclient locally.

For point 3, you could use this little script. However, it depends on
how your openssl.cnf is installed.
Copy this script into your $SSLDIR and execute it.

#!/bin/sh

# GGZ Gaming Zone
# Transport Layer Security Configuration
 
echo "Prepare environment (* CA *)"
echo "============================"
mkdir private/crl
mkdir private/newcerts
echo "01" > private/serial
touch private/index.txt

echo "Create self-signed CA certificate (* CA *)"
echo "=========================================="
./bin/openssl req -new -x509 -keyout private/cakey.pem -out private/cacert.pem

echo "Create a certificate request (* Server *)"
echo "========================================="
./bin/openssl req -new -keyout certs/newkey.pem -out certs/newreq.pem -days 365

echo "Signing the request (* CA* )"
echo "============================"
cat certs/newreq.pem certs/newkey.pem > certs/new.pem
./bin/openssl ca -out certs/newcert.pem -infiles certs/new.pem
rm certs/new.pem
