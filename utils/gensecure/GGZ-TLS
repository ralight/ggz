The GGZ Gaming Zone should provide encryption and data integrity one day.
In particular, the following scenarios are possible.
('-' means no TLS necessary, 'o' means recommended, 'x' means necessary)

Area            | Client | Server
----------------+--------+-------
Connection      |   -    |   o
Normal chat     |   -    |   -
Private chat    |   -    |   o
Game spectator  |   -    |   -
Game player     |   o    |   o
Registered game |   x    |   x

Please note that if the authentication is only on the server side,
only the encryption effect counts, not the authentication itself.

As there are many situations where the encryption is useful (i.e.
when the password is given to a freshly registered player), it is
strongly recommended that the GGZ server (ggzd) is preconfigured
with TLS support, once available.
The client doesn't need to have a certificate, but in order to
verify the player for global highscores or similar, we should
consider a policy which enforces this here too. However, this is
currently not possible because most players do probably not know
how to issue a certificate request, and we lack a CA infrastructure.
So please consider client authentication as an option for the future.
