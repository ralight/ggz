There are two utility programs currently available for developers/testers:

AGRUE - A Ggz Random User Emulator
  Used to simulate load on the server.  You must edit the defines PORT
  and HOSTNAME to setup the server you want to test load on.  This program
  will simply spawn random bots that login and move around chatting
  occasionally.

AGRUB - A Ggz Really Useful Bot (Grubby)
  Grubby is a prototype program to provide a service bot on a GGZ server.
  The code is fairly rough-and-ready, but should be expandable.  The default
  defines at the beginning of agrub.c can be overriden at run time.  Type
  'agrub --help' for a full listing of command line arguments.
