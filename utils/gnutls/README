A set of patches to enable GnuTLS usage.  These patches will probably be
very difficult to apply except to a CVS snapshot from Saturday, Jan 9 of
around 11:00 PM.

The file tls.c should be copied into the libggz sources directory.

This was written using version 0.3.4 of GnuTLS, other versions may require
changes since the library is under current development.

You will of course need GnuTLS (which requires libgcrypt) to compile this.
