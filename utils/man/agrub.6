.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Grubby is a chat bot, which means this program behaves like a human.
Once logged into a GGZ server, you can tell it some news it shall tell
others, and in return it tells you what it has heard of lately.
Additionally, if you say a bad word, it complains about it.
You can even rename grubby to what you want. Common names are
Highlander and Keeper, but you can invent your own ones.
