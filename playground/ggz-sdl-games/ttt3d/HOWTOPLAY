TicTacToe 3D
============

This is the 3D equivalent (using SDL with OpenGL) of the Gtk+ and KDE clients
for the GGZ TicTacToe game.

Wait until the board has been turned towards you. Then use the space keys to
position the cursor.
(If you don't see a cursor, it's not your turn yet).
Press enter to put your 'sign' (which is a 3D object here) onto the selected
cell of the board.

Keys
----

Cursor keys:
	Turn board around, affects lighting

Space:
	Move cursor

Enter:
	Make a move

T:
	Toggle textures (on by default)

ESC:
	Leave the game


Much fun!
