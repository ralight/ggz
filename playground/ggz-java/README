 The GGZ Gaming Zone - Java Implementation
 =========================================

 The efforts which have been put into free Java implementations
 show first results. A complete gaming environment using free Java
 components (GNU, jikes, org.*, ...) is now possible.

 This experimental package contains:
 - GGZDMod, an implementation of the GGZDMod library
 - TicTacToe, a sample game server
 - TicTacToeClient, an AWT-based frontend for the TTT server
 - Distributed GGZ, a test program which will eventually allow
   distruted chat

 All sources are covered by the GNU GPL.
