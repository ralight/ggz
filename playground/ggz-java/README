 The GGZ Gaming Zone - Java Implementation
 =========================================

 GGZ ships a Java package named ggz-java which contains a core client, a
 GGZCards game client and a TTT game client.

 This experimental package contains additional software which might move
 into ggz-java once completed:

 - jGGZDMod, an implementation of the GGZDMod library
   (includes TicTacToe, a sample game server)
 - TicTacToeClient, an AWT-based frontend for the TTT server
 - Distributed GGZ, a test program which will eventually allow
   distruted chat
