<h3>Installing GGZ</h3>
In order to play on the GGZ server, you will of course need GGZ installed
on your computer. Not all of GGZ is needed though - in fact, a core client
and maybe some more game clients are enough already.
<br/>

You can download the latest binary packages or source packages from the GGZ
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/releases/">download page</a>.
For the core client, choose either KGGZ (in ggz-kde-client) or GGZ-Gtk
(in ggz-gtk-client), depending on your preferences :-)
<br/>

<h3>Getting online</h3>
Once the client is installed, clicking on ggz:// links should work.
Alternatively, you can manually log in and then look for the relevant
rooms, such as Battleship or Reversi if you want to try out the new
KDE 4 games.
