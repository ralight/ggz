Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.14!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players,
and even review past games.
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking,
and includes a karma and matchmaking system, and a GGZ applet to play
some games directly in the browser.
GGZ support can be added to existing multiplayer games easily.

We're very pleased that a number of game projects have already
chosen GGZ as their internet gaming platform. Let's work hard to
bring as many multiplayer features into as many games as possible!

Features in this release:

- Player management, permissions and host players make playing on GGZ more fun
- Support for GNU Chess and Velena in our Chess and ConnectX servers
- Windows installer for the Gtk+ client
- The Metacle, a metaserver aggregator for cross-project game server access
- More GGZBoard games: Shogi and Sudoku
- Overhauled APIs for developers, including Pygame integration of game clients
- Dynamic room reconfiguration in the GGZ server
- Better KDE support through kggzmod and kggzgames libraries
- Improved GGZCards experience with player feedback for Gtk+ and Java clients

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with one
of the GGZ core clients to be able to start playing.
