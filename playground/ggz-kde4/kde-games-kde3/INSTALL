Installation of GGZ-Games-KDE
=============================

1. Make sure the package "easysock" is installed.

2. Make sure you have the correct versions of Qt
   and KDE installed. You need at least version 2.0
   of either one.

3. Type ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if not building from
   the CVS sources), make and make install (as root).

4. Have fun :)

5. Use the file README.GGZ in case there is any trouble, and for additional
information.
