How to play Muehle
------------------

There are different possibilities.
I found a very interesting GPL'd project, a Muehle server implemented in
Tcl/Tk. This is for demonstrational purpose (therefore the GUI), and has been a
task for students who had to write the game clients in Prolog...

The server is a single file and says:
muehle.tcl Copyright (C) 2001 Jochen Hoenicke.

The GGZ Muehle game will be compatible to the network protocol issued by this
server. There is a perl test script as well.
However, a new server implementation written in C++ will be provided too to
show how easy it is to code something up using the appropriate classes (in this
case, the freshly created QWeb and friends).

I don't know of any AI yet, but I'm much in favor of having this as an external
process spawned by the server or ggzd or a helper script.
Maybe we should invent something like AICommandLine :)
