GGZ Gaming Zone for KDE 4
=========================

This directory contains some bits of what shall become a
decent GGZ support for KDE 4 games. Note that it used to contain
more libraries, which have since however been moved to libkdegames
already.

Right now it contains the 'kggzdmod' library, which is a Qt-based version
of ggzdmod.
To compile it, change the include paths to kdecore in kggzdmod-kde4.pro,
run qmake-qt4 and finally make.

It also contains a port of the 'kconnectx' example game.
Compilation works similar to kggzdmod.

We also need CMake files :)
A first attempt at supporting GGZ in CMake can be found in
playground/buildsystem/cmake.
