GGZ Gaming Zone for KDE 4
=========================

This directory serves as incubator for new games, tools,
applications and libraries for the 'ggz-kde-center' package.
It also relates to the 'kdegames' package.

The older 'ggz-kde-client' and 'ggz-kde-games' packages have
also been moved here because some of their contents still need
to be ported. Already ported games and apps are marked with [ported].

The only pending new, non-ported application will be the complete
rewrite of KGGZ which is scheduled for ~August 2008.
