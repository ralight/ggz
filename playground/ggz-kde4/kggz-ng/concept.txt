Differences of the KDE4-based core client to the KDE3-based KGGZ:
- headless base library (kggzcore) to take care of all events, including
  connection/reconnection, protocol errors and such
- development focuses on usable widgets at first:
  seats list, player list, room list, table list, chat widget,
  connection dialogue
- also needs some better icons for players etc.
- finally, porting the tools such as team view (based on API?) and grubby
  dialogue
- only afterwards, creation of successor to GGZap based on Plasma, and
  porting of tools like KGrubby
