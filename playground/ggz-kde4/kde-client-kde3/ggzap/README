GGZap - GGZ Quick Launcher
==========================

This tool lets players play their favorite games without having to launch a
core client. GGZap works perfectly in the background if there is no other
player available, and launches the game immediately if a player is found on the
server which is configured. That's GGZ Europe One in normal case, but this can
be reconfigured.

ALREADY DONE IN 0.0.5:
- Handle different game UI's (gtk, kde, ...), together with modsniff
STARTED IN 0.0.6:
- Skinnable user interface (like KDE noatun does)
Wishlist for 0.0.7:
