Installation of GGZ-KDE
=======================

0. Are you sure you want to compile from source?
   There are pre-compiled binary packages available in Debian and RPM format
   which save lots of headache ;)

1. Make sure you have 2 packages installed:
	- libggz (for low level network functionality, and utily functions)
	- ggz-client-libs (for frontend protocol handling and the ggz-config tool)
   You can find ggzcore in the ggz-client-libs package.

2. Make sure you have the correct versions of Qt
   and KDE installed. You need at least version 2.0
   of either one.
   Qt 3.0 and KDE 3.0 will be supported from 0.0.6 on.

3. Type ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if not building from
   the CVS sources), make and make install (as root).
   Don't forget to run an ldconfig as well.

4. Have fun :)

5. A detailed GGZ installation help can be found in the project-wide used
   file README.GGZ.
