Description: GGZ Gaming Zone: core client for the GNOME2 desktop
 GGZ core clients enable players to access the GGZ server to chat,
 meet other people in the game lobbies, play with them, watch
 their scores and spectator other people's games.
 .
 The core client for GNOME has been intentionally kept simple to
 use. It does however not provide all GGZ features.
 .
 This package is part of the GGZ Gaming Zone, a multiuser
 networked gaming environment.
