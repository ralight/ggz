  * Move ggzd-config from the ggzd package to libggzdmod-dev so that
    ggz-kde-client doesn't have to depend on ggzd.

    causing ggzd to hang indefinately on hppa,
  Closes: #229623
  * However, ggzd isn't out of the woods as the db_open call from libdb3
    seems to have the same bug.  I've opened bug # to address this issue
    with the db3 maintainer.
  * Move ggzd from /usr/bin to /usr/sbin where it will be happier
