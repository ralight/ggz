Description: GGZ Gaming Zone: game clients collection for SDL
 GGZ games are games that can be played online against other people
 while all having some features in common, like table chat, seats
 configuration, bot players, game spectators, savegames, statistics
 and others. Some games also work in single-player mode.
 .
 This package provides games which have been developed using
 the SDL toolkit for Python (Pygame). It includes:
  * GGZBoard (engine for Chess, Checkers, Hnefatafl, Ludo, ...)
  * Xadrez-Chinês (Chinese Chess game)
  * Escape/SDL
  * Go-Wrapper (external, uses GNU Go)
 and much more!
 .
 A core client using Pygame, named Víbora, is also included here
 even though it is not a game. Similarly, the Python wrappers to
 the C libraries of GGZ and the Python-based game servers reside
 here also for the time being.
 .
 This package is part of the GGZ Gaming Zone, a multiuser
 networked gaming environment.
