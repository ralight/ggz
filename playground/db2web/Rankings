Team Membership
===============

The membership level in a team is determined by 3 factors:
* Success: indicated by number of crowns
  - one crown: just a starter
  - two crowns: already won a game or two
  - three crowns: won many games (> 10?)
* Hierarchy: indicated by the crown color
  - silver crown: regular member
  - gold crown: leadership team (leaders & vice-leaders)
* Importance: indicated by the symbol on the crown
  - no symbol: no special importance
  - diamonds: current leader
  - stars: team founder

Only the leader can upgrade and downgrade all persons,
including himself. There can only be one leader, so appointing
someone else as leader makes him a vice-leader!
Vice-leaders can upgrade members to vice-leaders.
They can select a leader from their ranks should the previous
leader disband from the team.
The founder of a team may disappear or become a regular member.

In order to become a team member, the leadership team has to
approve you.

Team Rankings
=============

The team ladder is indicated with cups. The more cups a team
has won, the higher it rises.
There are gold cups (who count threefold), silver cups and
bronze cups.

There are game-based rankings (in which only the relevant cups
count) and global rankings for all games on a server.
Rankings also exist tournament-based and tournament-class based.

Player rankings
===============

Similar to the teams, the player ladder is indicated with
cups, although different ones.

As well as with the games, tournament winners in addition
receive the diamond symbol. The overall tournament class
winner receives the star symbol in addition.

Also, the top 3 of both game-based and global rankings
have golden cups.
