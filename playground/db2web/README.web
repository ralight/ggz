db2web - prototype for a web-based GGZ community platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the 'web' directory into the document root of your web server,
and point your browser to the pages.

Database connection parameters will later be made available by something like
/etc/ggz/db2web.conf, right now they're hardcoded into index.php.

All the icons are from kggz, they need improvement.

No i18n is done yet.
