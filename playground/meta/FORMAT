MetAggregator needs to support a superset of all of the information of the
metaservers it aggregates. This can by definition not be a fixed format,
since new metaservers might be added over time.
The XML format has been designed so that adding new information tags
will be possible.

Current MetAggregator format (revision 0.1):
--------------------------------------------

Only uri is needed for the service being useful. The MetAggregator
implementation will however always provide all tags.

//title {string} - human-readable string for display, will be auto-generated if missing
uri {string} - connection information, containing the following components:
- host {string} - hostname the server runs on (part of URI)
- port {integer} - port number the server runs on (part of URI)
- protocol {string} - game protocol name, if available (part of URI)
version {string} - version number of the game server
- patches {string} - modifications to a version, as attribute to the version tag
state {string} - current game state (see CONSTANTS)
topic {string} - game topic or description
players {integer} - number of players in the game
available {integer} - open seats
//serverid {integer} - unique identifier for this game server instance

gameserver - top-level tag for each entry
- gamename {string} - game name, as attribute to the gameserver tag

Constants for state: pregame, running, ...
