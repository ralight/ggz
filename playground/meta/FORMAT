%% TODO: gameroom flag (no topic, players, available, state)

Metacle needs to support a superset of all of the information of the
metaservers it aggregates. This can by definition not be a fixed format,
since new metaservers might be added over time.
The XML format has been designed so that adding new information tags
will be possible.

Queries performed by Metacle clients
------------------------------------

Right now, only a listing is supported:

<list />

To restrict the listing to a certain game type, the gamename
parameter must be added:

<list gamename="foo" />

In addition, a timestamp can be given to signal to Metacle to not list
all games, but to list the differences since this time:

<list timestamp="1147589942" />

Current Metacle format (revision 0.1):
--------------------------------------

Only uri is needed for the service being useful. The Metacle
implementation will however always provide all tags.

uri {string} - connection information, containing the following components:
- host {string} - hostname the server runs on (part of URI)
- port {integer} - port number the server runs on (part of URI)
- protocol {string} - game protocol name, if available (part of URI)
- path {string} - game room, if part of a gaming centre (part of URI)
version {string} - version number of the game server
- patches {string} - modifications to a version, as attribute to the version tag
state {string} - current game state (see CONSTANTS)
topic {string} - game topic or description
players {integer} - number of players in the game
available {integer} - open seats

gameserver - top-level tag for each entry
- gamename {string} - game name, as attribute to the gameserver tag
- timestamp {integer} - current time on the server, as attribute
