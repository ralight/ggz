	<h4>About MetAggregator</h4>
	<p>
		MetAggregator is a fundamental change of finding currently running
		online games. Instead of letting the client applications perform
		the querying of game servers, the service aggregates the data and
		provides it in a unified format.
		This forms the base to a user-friendly desktop integration of
		online games, which is one of the fundamental goals of the
		GGZ Gaming Zone project, a free gaming integration project which
		provides networking services to many games.
