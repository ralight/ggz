Stuff to do before release:

  * BEFORE RELEASE
    - Verify "make distcheck" works for all modules.  For gtk-games and
      kde-games you'll need "make DESTDIR=~/ggz distcheck".
    - Update RPM .spec files.

  * FEATURE FREEZE
    - Run msgmerge on po files.  This varies by module.
    - Bump version numbers in configure.in for each module.
    - Update QuickStart.GGZ and README.GGZ.
    - Bump game version numbers from e.g. "2-pre1" to "2", where applicable.
    - Bump Doxyfile version numbers (ggzdmod, libggz, ggzcore, ggzmod).
    - Regenerate Doxygen man pages (ggzdmod, libggz, ggzcore, ggzmod).
    - Write NEWS.
    - Generate ChangeLog (how?).

  * RELEASE
    - Run "make dist" to generate tarballs for each module.
    - Add distribution files to SF's file manager.
    - Generate .rpm and .deb files; add them to SF's file manager.
    - Update the download document (currently dl.php; this file should be
      manually edited).

  * ANNOUNCEMENT
    - An article on ggz.sf.net
    - Announcement on linuxgames, freshmeat, etc.
    - E-mail to ggz-dev.

  * CLEAN-UP
    - Update all sorts of web documentation: REAMDE.GGZ and QuickStart.GGZ,
      api docs, etc.
