Ruby bindings for libggzdmod
============================

It is now possible for game developers to let Ruby games run over GGZ.
The ggzdmod functions are representated by a GGZDMod object, which does all
the necessary work.

You need the 'ggzdmod' library installed from the 'ggz-server' package
The statistics/rankings functionality will be added later, but at least
basic game servers are supported now.

To compile, just do the following:
	% ruby extconf.rb [--with-opt-dir=/path/to/ggz-install]
	% make
This should build a GGZDMod.so shared library for you, which gets installed as
a ruby extension if you type in the following as root:
	$ make install
Note: for testing the server locally (i.e. with testserver-launch.sh), no such
installation as root is needed.

To install the RubyToe example game, do the following (might need root for
system-wide GGZ install):
	% cp rubytoe /path/to/ggz-install/lib/ggzd
	% cp rubytoe.dsc /path/to/ggz-install/etc/ggzd/games
	% cp rubytoe.room /path/to/ggz-install/etc/ggzd/rooms
The network handler must be installed as a Ruby extension as root (unless
testing locally).
	$ sitelibdir=`ruby -r rbconfig -e 'puts(Config::CONFIG["sitelibdir"])'`
	$ cp rubytoenet.rb $sitelibdir

Finally, test by running:
	% ./testserver-launch.sh

Note that the TTT AI written in pure Ruby is very weak. This is intentional -
please do not spend time on improving it! What can instead be done is to
compile and install the 'ttt-ai' extension, which re-uses the AI from the
tictactoe server written in C through Ruby bindings.
