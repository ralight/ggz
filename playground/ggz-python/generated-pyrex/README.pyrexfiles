Pyrex python wrapper definition files for ggzcore.
Contributed by ha shao <hashao2@myrealbox.com> under ??? license.
Probably to be used after the GGZ 0.0.9 release.

Note, that this wrapper tries to map the C version 1:1.
For a more abstract wrapper, please have a look at the (old) pyggzcore
wrapper in ggz-python (from 0.0.9 on).
