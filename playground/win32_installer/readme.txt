Prototype installer for ggz-gtk on win32. This is pretty incomplete at the moment.

Download nsis ( http://nsis.sf.net/ ) to create the installer.

Copy all of these files to <msys install path>\local\
Assumes you have GTK installed in C:\GTK and MinGW installed in <msys install path>\..\MinGW

i.e. C:\unix\MinGW and C:\unix\msys\1.0

Process ggz_gtk_win32.nsi to produce the installer exe.
