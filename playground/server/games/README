Velena AI engine
----------------

The game ConnectX can support the Velena AI which has been proven
to be correct and uses an opening book for full strength play.
A special bot named 'Velena' is available in the NamedBots section
of the server.

To use the Velena AI, the following must be done:
* go to http://www.ce.unipr.it/~gbe/velena.html
* download Velena
* compile and install 'veleng' to $PATH
* install white_ob.cn4 to new directory /usr/share/games/velena
  (or change location in velena-connectx)
* copy velena-connectx to $PATH

Note:
 Only games on 7x6 boards are supported by the 'veleng'
 command line version.
 The connect length is 4 (I think).
 Ideally, velena would be a library, but a configurable
 command line engine would also be nice to have,
 especially for scripting languages which saves the work for
 writing wrapper libraries.
