Asynchronous nameserver lookups in GGZ
--------------------------------------

Rationale:
Networking operations in GGZ applications should never block.
This can be achieved by using appropriate binary network
protocols based on the DIO paradigm, or by using text or
XML protocols.
However, name server lookups have due to historical reasons
traditionally been blocking. Some higher-level toolkits
bring their own APIs, but for applications based on libc and
libggz we need to provide a simple equivalent, preferably
without enforcing a main loop like all the toolkits do.

GAI/ANL:
GAI, or getaddrinfo(), is the new libc function for name
server lookups, replacing gethostname() and its ilk. There
is a GNU libc extension called getaddrinfo_a() which can
perform the lookup asynchronously by either sending a
signal or creating a new thread when it completes. To use
it, the linker line needs to contain -lanl.

Issue:
There seems to be a bug in libanl or libc's aio layer which
makes the lookup crash sometimes, independent of the
form of delivery. This needs further debugging until the
appropriate code, which is already in libggz, can be
enabled by default and recommended for use.
