	The GGZ Playground
	==================

	"Uh", said the little game, "when I've grown up I want to become a really
	strong game!"

	No problem, saith the older ones... but mature in the playground first!
	You'll find lots of friends here who will help you during you grow up.

	"Cool", replied the little game.
	And started to become really strong...


	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This CVS module is not intended for distribution.
	Therefore it can be used for new projects which will eventually move into
	another GGZ CVS module, or even found a new one.

	Each sub directory will have its own configuration files, unless this
	will not make sense anymore (right now it does).

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	A summary of what is contained (might be out of date):

	Agrue:
		A GGZ Real User Emulator

		Debug utily which colorizes network traffic.

	GGZ-Java:
	GGZ-Python:
	GGZ-Ruby:
		Language bindings for GGZ and some apps/games programmed in these
		languages.
		If you don't like C or C++, this is your chance!

		A Gtk+/SDL game. Needs to be cleaned up, and before any release
		the sounds and graphics have to get rid of any copyright/trademark
		issues.
