	The GGZ Playground
	==================

	"Uh", said the little game, "when I've grown up I want to become a really
	strong game!"

	No problem, saith the older ones... but mature in the playground first!
	You'll find lots of friends here who will help you during you grow up.

	"Cool", replied the little game.
	And started to become really strong...


	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This SVN module is not intended for distribution.
	Therefore it can be used for new projects which will eventually move into
	another GGZ SVN module, or even found a new one.

	Each sub directory will have its own configuration files, unless this
	will not make sense anymore (right now it does).

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	A summary of what is contained (might be out of date):

	Agrue:
		A GGZ Real User Emulator
		Simulates high load on servers. Was recently ported and works again.

	Buildsystem:
		Experimental scons build system files for libggz, as alternative to the
		autotools. Also includes CMake checks for GGZ.

	C-Base:
		C programming taken to the next level. Some experimental functions
		for safe programming.

	Chess-Pieces:
		Metafont files (scalable) for free chess figures.

	Colorsniff:
		Debug utility which colorizes network traffic.

	Community:
		Frontpage news and articles for "our" instance of ggzcommunity.org,
		since GGZ Community can be deployed by other projects as well.

	Db2Web:
		Old (probably deprecated) stuff from the ancestor of GGZ Community.

	Doc-i18n:
		Translation of Doxygen API documentation. Very work-intensive but
		a good idea to attract more developers.

	Freeciv:
		Patches for GGZ integration into the freeciv game.

	Gamedata:
		Add-on packages containing levels, themes and so on.
		This will be moved to a dedicated download server later (via GHNS).

	Gentoo:
		Ebuild files for the gentoo distribution.

	GGZCollector:
		Fire-'n-forget highscore collecting server for games with GGZ support
		without running in GGZ mode (e.g. possible for Frozen Bubble).

	GGZ-Java:
	GGZ-Python:
	GGZ-Ruby:
		Language bindings for GGZ and some apps/games programmed in these
		languages.
		If you don't like C or C++, this is your chance!
		Note that GGZ-Python is already a package on its own, and only some
		experimental extensions are here in playground.
		Likewise, GGZ-Java5 is rather complete, whereas GGZ-Java is quite old.

	Haskell:
		Some Sudoku creation and solver software written in the functional
		programming language Haskell.

	Kopete-GGZ:
		GGZ plugin for the Kopete IM client. Should be moved to kde-client
		actually.

	Maintenance:
		Server and repository maintenance scripts for GGZ developers.
		Also some website tools and documentation.

	Meta:
		Metacle, the metaserver aggregator.
		Will stay here for quite some time since it is intended to be run
		on one server only.

	MingW:
		Information on how to compile GGZ on windows.

	Patches:
		Non-structured, partly non-working patches.
		If you have a good one just add it here.

	POVray:
		Original POVray sources of the GGZ project logo.

	Server:
		Code generation framework for data handling in multi-threaded code.
		Might be of use for future ggzd development.

	XMLGettext:
		An xgettext variant to extract textual information from xml files.

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Graveyard:
	The following directories existed here but were either moved out of
	playground (grown-ups) or deleted for other reason.

	- Gaim-Plugin  (-> now in gtk-client/gaim-plugin)
	- GGZWars      (removed)
	- SDL-Games    (-> now sdl-games module)
	- GGZ-Java5    (-> now java module)
