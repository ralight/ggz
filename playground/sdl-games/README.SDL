Games using the Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL) should be placed here
while being developed.
They will eventually be released as ggz-sdl-games.

This intersects with the idea of pygame, which is SDL for Python and should
belong into the upcoming python package, because python is a more difficult
dependency than SDL (IMO).
