There are so many things left to do to make this a truly professional release. This file is a record of all the things that I can think of that need to be done.


Core Client
===========
Add a private chat window so that two players can have a private conversation. Currently the only way to do this is to use the /msg command.

Add some board games, Reversi, Chess and Checkers are good candidates.

Add support for multi-platform browser launching for hyperlinks like card game help.

Add support for launching non-java games (i.e. implement new Mod that supports sockets)

Add support for launching Java games from non-Java core client.


All Card Games
==============
Don't show opponent cards unless they are face up, this will help with layout for more than four players and reduces visual clutter. It allows for more choices for embelishments etc.

Scale the cards and other widgets when the window is resized.

The "How to Play" link doesn't work when a popup blocker is in effect. Find a way to get around this or alert the user to this fact.

Consider a "Leave" button so that closing the window is not the only way to leave the game.

Include a tutorial mode to help novice players learn how to play the game.

Consider a square layout at all times, place chat either below or to the side depending on which screen dimension is the largest. This will be needed when we implement scaling of cards.


Bridge
======
Use specialised bid controls rather than buttons for bidding. The controls could have toggle buttons from 1-7 and toggle buttons for each of the strains.


Hearts
======
Support more than four players

Handle two decks layout a little better


Suaro
=====
Create a custom bid panel similar to what is proposed for Bridge.


Whist
=====
Display dealer up card in a visual way, either during the deal and/or with an icon during play. At the least, trump should be indicated with an icon during play.
