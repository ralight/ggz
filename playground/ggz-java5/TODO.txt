There are so many things left to do to make this a truly professional release. This file is a record of all the things that I can think of that need to be done.


Core Client
===========
Add a private chat window so that two players can have a private conversation. Currently the only way to do this is to use the /msg command.



All Card Games
==============
Don't show opponent cards unless they are face up, this will help with layout for more than four players and reduces visual clutter. It allows for more choices for embelishments etc.


Bridge
======
Use specialised bid controls rather than buttons for bidding. The controls could have toggle buttons from 1-7 and toggle buttons for each of the strains.


Hearts
======
Support more than four players

Handle two decks layout a little better


Suaro
=====
Create a custom bid panel similar to what is proposed for Bridge.


Whist
=====
Display dealer up card in a visual way, either during the deal and/or with an icon during play. At the least, trump should be indicated with an icon during play.
