There are so many things left to do to make this a truly professional release.
This file is a record of all the things that I can think of that need to be done.


Core Client
===========
Add a private chat window so that two players can have a private conversation.
Currently the only way to do this is to use the /msg command.

Add some board games, Reversi, Chess and Checkers are good candidates.

Add support for launching non-java games (i.e. implement new Mod that supports
sockets)

Add support for launching Java games from non-Java core client.

MegaGrub help message on first login is confusing. His welcome text is great
but the bit about "type help to change this :)" is confusing. The Smiley
makes it not obvious that he is a bot and is giving you instructions and
some users don't recognise smiley's (my dad didn't). People are using the
applet to play games, not type obtuse commands into a chat window so that
they can register themselves. The web site does this adequately already; we
don't need to remove the chat bot functionality, we just don't need to
advertise it when you first log in. Maybe MegaGrub can chime in with a help
tip if the user send "help" as chat.

Support chat buffer size properly so that we don't send to big a message after encoding to UTF-8.

Add i18n support.


All Card Games
==============
Scale the cards and other widgets when the window is resized.

The "How to Play" link doesn't work when a popup blocker is in effect. Find a
way to get around this or alert the user to this fact...After researching this
it appears that there is no way to get around the IE or Google pop-up
blockers.

Consider a "Leave" button so that closing the window is not the only way to 
leave the game; closing the window it not intuitive for all users.

Include a tutorial mode to help novice players learn how to play the game.

The applet currently does not fit well on a screen resolution of 800x600 but
it needs to.

Support named bots or change names from AI to Computer 1, Computer 2 etc.

Hide chat when all opponents are AI players.

Show lag indicator, when there is lag there is no indication why a computer
player is not playing a card.

Show indicator or play sound when it's your turn. The "Playing..." text is not
enough.

Find out why "Connection Reset" exception occurs, especially, when leaving the
game "sitting" for a few minutes...I've added Socket.setKeepAlive(true) so this
should solve it.

Allow player to look at cards in last trick etc. (according to the rules of
the game)


Bridge
======
Use specialised bid controls rather than buttons for bidding. The controls
could have toggle buttons from 1-7 and toggle buttons for each of the strains.


Hearts
======
Support more than four players

Handle two decks layout a little better

Hand lost message only reports points taken by loser, this message is 
confusing and should be removed as there's no loser in a hand of hearts, the
running totals are enough.

La Pocha
========
How to Play URL points to old GGZ site.

Spades
======
Why is there both a 0 and nil bid?

The numbers in brackets are confusing. It's not obvious that the first number
is the bid/number of tricks for the player and the second number in brackets
is for the team.

GGZ-Cards version of Spades seems to have more options, what's going on?

Suaro
=====
Create a custom bid panel similar to what is proposed for Bridge.


Whist
=====
Display dealer up card in a visual way, either during the deal and/or with an
icon during play. At the least, trump should be indicated with an icon during
play.
