Some problems with the GNU Autotools
 (they're documented here but may move into the real build docs if
  some of the issues seem to be really bad ones)

Subdirectories
--------------

Some versions of automake get the SUBDIRS variable wrong (e.g. 1.9.5).
If it is set, then it will not be properly reset in the child directories
that make up its value.
A possible cause might be mixing Autoconf-style @SUBDIRS@ with Automake-style
$(SUBDIRS). Only the latter should be used!
The issue led to a whole bunch of "SUBDIRS = ." workarounds in the affected
child directories throughout GGZ SVN.

Since somewhen in 2006 those workarounds are being removed.
