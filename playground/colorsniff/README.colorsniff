Colorsniff allows you to follow the GGZ protocol exchange between a client and
a server.
It highlights traffic from either side with a special color, acting as a
wrapper around the output of 'ngrep'.
A neat feature is to turn off the display of PING/PONG.

A sample call looks like that:
ngrep -d lo | ./colorsniff.pl --noping

You need the perl module Term::ANSIColor installed, but this is normally part
of every perl installation.
