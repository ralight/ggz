ggz-ircgate: Relay chat between GGZ and IRC chat

With this tool, room chat from GGZ can be forwarded to IRC,
and vice-versa. It works on a 1:1 mapping between GGZ room and
IRC channel.

As opposed to ggzd-jabberproxy, this doesn't actually combine GGZ
functionality with a chat network. Instead, it really just focuses on
relaying the chat messages.
