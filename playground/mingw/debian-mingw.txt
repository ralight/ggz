Here's how to cross-compile GGZ for Mingw:

1) Installation of required packages

$ apt-get install mingw32

This pulls in the mingw32-runtime package containing header files and
libraries which are usually available on Windows, equivalent to libc.
It also pulls in the binutils which can work on executables of the
mingw32 architecture.

Location of the header files:
/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/include/*.h

2) Cross-compilation

./configure [...] --host=i586-mingw32msvc

All checks should then return results as if the configure script was
executed on a Windows machine.

Currently, the configuration of ggz-base-libs fails as soon as it needs
a library not part of conventional libc.
This applies to gettext, pthreads, expat etc.
