Compiling GGZ on Windows with Mingw/MSYS
========================================


Make a home directory
=====================

If you've not got a directory which is pointed to by the HOME environment variable then:

Create c:\unix\home

Add the environment variable HOME as c:\unix\home


Get the Sources
===============

Use http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ to get the latest dev sources if you've not got them. Put them in c:\unix\home or your home directory


Install libggz
==============

Run msys (you'll need to restart it if you've played with environment variables)

cd ~/ggz/libggz

We need to edit autogen.sh to get rid of bash-isms. The bash that is supplied for msys gave me no end of problems, so I've just stuck to plain sh.

Change line 1 from

#!/usr/bin/env bash

to

#!/usr/bin/env sh

Change line 93 from 

set -o pipefile 2>/dev/null && { ((cd $srcdir && ...

to

cd $srcdir && automake --add-missing --gnu


Now run

./autogen.sh --disable-threading
make
make install


Install ggz-client-libs
=======================

cd ~/ggz/ggz-client-libs

We need to edit autogen.sh to get rid of bash-isms. The bash that is supplied for msys gave me no end of problems, so I've just stuck to plain sh.

Change line 1 from

#!/usr/bin/env bash

to

#!/usr/bin/env sh

Change line 93 from 

set -o pipefile 2>/dev/null && { ((cd $srcdir && ...

to

cd $srcdir && automake --add-missing --gnu


Now run

CPPFLAGS=-I/c/unix/home/ggz/ggz-client-libs/ggzcore ./autogen.sh --disable-ggzwrap

Edit config.h to fix GGZDATADIR if it's still broken (is set to ${prefix}/share/ggz at the moment)

You probably want to set these so more windows like behaviour is used.

GAMEDIR=../lib/ggz
GGZCONFDIR=../etc
GGZDATADIR=../share/ggz


make
make install


Install gtk-client
==================


cd ~/ggz/gtk-client

We need to edit autogen.sh to get rid of bash-isms. The bash that is supplied for msys gave me no end of problems, so I've just stuck to plain sh.

Change line 1 from

#!/usr/bin/env bash

to

#!/usr/bin/env sh

Change line 93 from 

set -o pipefile 2>/dev/null && { ((cd $srcdir && ...

to

cd $srcdir && automake --add-missing --gnu


Now run

./autogen.sh --disable-nls

No nls because otherwise gettext wants to compile against a non-existant static libintl.a. If you can figure out why, I'd be happy to know!

Edit ggz-gtk/main.c and comment out all instances of strsep()

make
make install


Install gtk-games
=================

cd ~/ggz/gtk-client

We need to edit autogen.sh to get rid of bash-isms. The bash that is supplied for msys gave me no end of problems, so I've just stuck to plain sh.

Change line 1 from

#!/usr/bin/env bash

to

#!/usr/bin/env sh

Change line 93 from 

set -o pipefile 2>/dev/null && { ((cd $srcdir && ...

to

cd $srcdir && automake --add-missing --gnu


Now run

If you get lots of errors when running autogen.sh, try

dos2unix configure.ac



CPPFLAGS=-I/c/unix/home/ggz/gt-games/common ./autogen.sh --disable-nls
make
make install
