Hello TeXnicans,

  Here comes my version of a chess-font (elch), and TeX-Macros for use
with TeX and LaTeX. This file is not the documentation, on how to use
the macros, or the fonts, but gives a litte history and some remarks on
this package. Unfortunatly I haven't found the time yet to do a fairly
good documentation, but since some friends asked me to provide these
things - here I do so. You can look at the file diag.ger.tex (for
germans like me :-), or at diag.engl.tex (for the rest of the world),
to get a small feeling on how to use it.

  Included in this package are all the MF-sources, the neccessary TeX
macros, and also tfm-files and pk-files for 300dpi printer. If need
other resolutions, get MF2.00 or a later release running and generate
them. If you have trouble, you can drop me a e-mail, but no guaranty 
to get help immediatly or later. To use the TeX macros you will need
TeX3.00 or later.

  This is a special package for setting chess-diagrams, especially to set
diagrams for fairy-chess boards. I did this font, to help my father in
producing a small magazine named PROBLEMKISTE. In former times, he had
to set the diagramms with scissors and glue resulting in nice diagrams,
but also consuming a huge amount of time. Since PROBLEMKISTE is a fairy
chess magazine, you can set all figures roted by 90 degrees (left,
right and upsidedown), and in white, black and neutral.

  I designed this font with an eye to traditional chess fonts appearing
in a lot of magazines. But also personal taste influenced the forms of
the figures.

  This font is the first font i designed, and therefore the first font
done by me with METAFONT. And this shows. Experienced users of METAFONT
will have a lot of recomendations on how to do it better, or how to do
it the right way.  Suggestions are welcome, but I doubt whether I will
have enough time to do it. METAFONT is fun - as long as you have a fast
machine.  I started on a microvax II in 1989, and did the last changes
to the fonts on a HP9000/720 (this is REAL fun!!!), but nevertheless,
METAFONTing is VERY timeconsuming.

  The TeXmacros going with this font are undergoing steady changes. 
Since with every new feature needed to make a better look of
PROBLEMKISTE i do some hacking as far as neccessary.  All macros needed
to do the PROBLEMKISTE are based on plainTeX, therefore also the
elch-macros are based on plainTeX. I'am not an user of LaTeX. Despite
this fact, i hacked the tex-source to be usable under LaTeX, but it
follows in no way the conventions of LaTeX (as far as I can judge it),
and it well may be that there are problems in using it with LaTeX.
I only tried the diag*.tex with LaTeX.
