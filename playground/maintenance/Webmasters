GGZ Gaming Zone Webmasters Reference
====================================

The CVS module which keeps the web pages is called 'www'.
Both the 'www' and the 'dev' subdomain rely on them.
This reference explains some concepts.

File types
----------
PHP is used as a base. However not much PHP functions are used,
it merely serves 2 purposes:
- dynamic content negotiation, error pages and alternatives
- future enhancements

For images, PNG should be used. Thumbnails are 128x96 pixels.

Layout
------
The page headers and footers are always the same, thus include
files are used. Design elements are the main box, image (thumbnail)
boxes and lists. All of those have specific CSS elements.

Internationalization
--------------------
Mostly, apache content negotiation is used. This has one severe drawback:
If a web page is available in language x.php.foo, but the browser only accepts
bar, no web page at all is served. Adding x.php would however always override
the browser language. The key is to have x.php.php as the fallback solution.

Maintenance
-----------
The script missingtranslation.pl should be called from time to time,
especially using the --defaults parameter, in /var/www/ggz/www.
The generated files should not be added to CVS.

Links
-----
Links should not end up in /file.php but rather in /file/. This allows for
later enhancements by creating a directory /file/ and renaming /file.php to
/file/index.php.
Images are to be placed in /pics/section/, or (if /section/ exists)
/section/pics/.
