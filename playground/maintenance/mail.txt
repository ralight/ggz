E-Mail addresses in the GGZ project
===================================

A number of direct addresses and mailing lists exist to reach GGZ people.
This little piece of documentation tries to summarise them. Note that
aliases are case-insensitive!

In the following text, the hostname 'ggz' represents ggzgamingzone.org
whereas 'community' represents ggzcommunity.org.
This is meant as a slight defense against spammers.

++ Community e-mail ++

Sending mail to hosting@community is used to coordinate tournament hosting
requests. This is forwarded transparently to the hosting@mail.ggz list.

For administrative purposes, ggznagios@community is set up to refer to
the 'ggznagios' account at twitter.com. Nagios running at hq sends monitoring
incidences to that account.

The address info@community exists for general inquiries.
Actually all <foo>@community is redirected there but this might stop somewhen.

++ Project e-mail ++

According to RFC 2142, several addresses are a must-have.
Those are abuse@ggz, noc@ggz, security@ggz for generic network operations,
and postmaster@ggz, hostmaster@ggz and webmaster@ggz for specific services.
For FTP, it's ftp@ggz (there is no ftpmaster alias), and there is also
www@ggz as a webmaster alias.

In addition, admin@ggz is a contact for project issues such as the IANA
port reservations.

All of those addresses go to the root user, and subsequently to a developer
account. For some addresses such as security@ggz a mailing list
might make sense in the future.

Note that root@ggz has a corresponding OpenPGP key which is actually the
hostmaster key. It is used to sign off new releases on ftp.ggz.

++ Mailing lists ++

Several mailing lists run on the virtual domain mail.ggz. This is done so
they could be offloaded to another server in case of increased traffic,
which however only seems to be a theoretical issue.
The listing of active mailing lists can be seen here:
https://mail.ggzgamingzone.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo

In addition, several control aliases with the list name as a prefix as well
as a generic list mailman@mail.ggz exist.

++ Personal addresses ++

Also, all system users get mail delivered to their account directly.
This includes all GGZ developers and some special users, all of who
have got a home directory under /home/<username>.
The use of a .forward file is recommended to prevent a local mbox
file from growing too fast.
GGZ developers can be reached at <username>@ggz.
