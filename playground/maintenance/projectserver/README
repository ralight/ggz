Redundancy:

Mirroring via rsync -avz ggzgamingzone.org::

http: redundancy through mirrors, via anonymous rsync:
      * de.ggzgamingzone.org (www, ftp) [currently defunct]
      * fr.ggzgamingzone.org (www, ftp) [manually]
      * wwwmirror.ggzgamingzone.org (www)
      goal: trusted (dynamic) or untrusted (static) mirror
      possible for mantis and rankings, not for websvn and mailman interface
ftp:  redundancy through download mirrors, via anonymous rsync:
      * niue.belnet.be (Belgium, twice daily)
        ftp://ftp.belnet.be/mirrors/ftp.ggzgamingzone.org
        http://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/ftp.ggzgamingzone.org/
      * munin.dotsrc.org (Denmark, daily)
        ftp://ftp.dotsrc.org/mirrors/ggzgamingzone
        http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ggzgamingzone/
      * login.ibiblio.org (USA, daily)
        ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/ggzgamingzone
        http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/ggzgamingzone/
svn:  redundancy through mirrors, via anonymous rsync:
      * abracurcix (private server, weekly)
      FIXME: svn:externals not supported, thus no anonsvn possible

mail: is supported by fail-over mx (mail.hostsharing.net) [deactivated]
      mailing lists are write-only!
      using mail-archive.com is an option
live: provides no redundancy
      could be supported by alternative server (...)
      would use another database!
bugs: provides no redundancy
      goal: not needed

Backups:

http: none, maintained via svn
mail: user-defined for address forwards
      mailing lists: tarball (/var/lib/mailman) and weekly rsync backups
bugs: database: tarball (/var/lib/mysql)
svn: weekly rsync backups
ftp: weekly rsync backups
system: tarballs (/etc)

live/ggzcommunity: daily database dumps maintained in svn repo
