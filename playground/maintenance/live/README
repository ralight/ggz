======================

This server is primarily running ggzd on port 5688.
But it also hosts the Java applet, since it needs to be downloaded
from the same host it is going to connect to.

The applet, as well as the application variant of it for usage
with Java Web Start, can be built in ggz-java with the command:
 ant applet-jar application-jar

The two resulting JAR files can optionally be signed, but should
rather not, and then must be placed into this directory.
