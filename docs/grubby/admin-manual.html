<A NAME="install">
<FONT SIZE=4>Installation</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Grubby consists of the binary "grubby", the perl script "grubby-config", lots
of plugins (shared libraries), scripts for modexec and modembed, and data and
translation files. Everything should install fine.
All you have to do then is to call grubby-config, which gives you a full
default installation. You might want to cut the options down, just edit the
configuration files under $HOME/.ggz.
Then launch the bot while having a ggzd running somewhere.
If it fails, make sure you didn't cut too much options.
Read docs/Setup for a sample file.

<A NAME="commands">
<FONT SIZE=4>Admin Commands</FONT>
<BR><BR>
The owner of grubby, as specified in the configuration, may issue some more commands than the other players. Here's a list of what the admin can do:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>grubby insmod (modulename) - Inserts a plugin, like self or badword
<LI>grubby rmmod (modulename) - Unloads a plugin
<LI>grubby reload (modulename) - A combination of the above, makes sure the latest version is in memory
<LI>grubby modules - List all loaded plugins
<LI>grubby goto (roomnumber) - Let grubby join the given room
<LI>grubby log (on|off) - Control whether the bot should log messages or not
</UL>

<A NAME="modexec">
<FONT SIZE=4>Exec Module</FONT>
<BR><BR>
This plugin executes external scripts and programs, writes to their stdin and reads from their stdout. It should be noted that the more
external processes are spawned in serial order, the more time it consumes, and grubby may not react fast enough. Whereever available, a native
plugin (shared library) should be preferred.
<BR><BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="modembed">
<FONT SIZE=4>Embed Module</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Similar to modexec, save it embeds the scripts directly. This works for python
and ruby so far and requires that support for those languages has been enabled
at compile time.
One advantage is that all commands are executed much faster.

<HR>
<A NAME="modnews">
<FONT SIZE=4>News Module (modexec)</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Several news sites offer RDF files which contain all headlines and links to the articles in XML format. Now  when the user
requests news from one of those sites, the module first fetches the latest RDF file from the target host (needs the perl module
Net::Telnet installed), and randomly seeks one of the headlines which is to be returned.

<HR>
<A NAME="moddict">
<FONT SIZE=4>Dictionary Module (modexec)</FONT>
<BR><BR>
This module is presentated by the perl script "dict.pl", which in turn needs several dictionaries installed, or at least one of them.
Under Unix, those are mostly under /usr/share/trans/X-Y, where X and Y are lowercase language letters, like "en" for English. The
dictionary files contain key:value pairs of words. Now when a search is done, the module simply opens the appropriate file and scans
it. In the case of inverse search, key and value are swapped. The module returns a concatenated string which contains all translations
it found for the key word.
<BR><BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="modmeeting">
<FONT SIZE=4>Meeting Module (modexec)</FONT>
<BR><BR>
This one needs Ruby installed, preferably version 1.6+. Its configurable database goes normally to /tmp/meetings, you might want to
change that. It uses an interesting technique to store its data: Instead of writing key-value pairs, it dumps the whole object
so one can transfer it from one host to another :)
<BR><BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="modtrans">
<FONT SIZE=4>Translation Module (modexec)</FONT>
<BR><BR>
In case common shell tools (cut, grep, ...) and wget are available, the script
webtrans.sh can be used for translations. It stores translated pairs of
sentences into its cache (~/.ggz/grubby/google).
