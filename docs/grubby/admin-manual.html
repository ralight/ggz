<A NAME="modnews">
<FONT SIZE=4>News Module</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Several news sites offer RDF files which contain all headlines and links to the articles in XML format. Now  when the user
requests news from one of those sites, the module first fetches the latest RDF file from the target host (needs the perl module
Net::Telnet installed), and randomly seeks one of the headlines which is to be returned.

<A NAME="moddict">
<FONT SIZE=4>Dictionary Module</FONT>
<BR><BR>
This module is presentated by the perl script "dict.pl", which in turn needs several dictionaries installed, or at least one of them.
Under Unix, those are mostly under /usr/share/trans/X-Y, where X and Y are lowercase language letters, like "en" for English. The
dictionary files contain key:value pairs of words. Now when a search is done, the module simply opens the appropriate file and scans
it. In the case of inverse search, key and value are swapped. The module returns a concatenated string which contains all translations
it found for the key word.
