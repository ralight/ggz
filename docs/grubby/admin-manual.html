<h2>Grubby Administration Manual</h2>

<small>
<i>Revision: 0.5</i><br>
<i>Date: 26.03.2005</i><br>
<i>Author: Josef Spillner &lt;josef at ggzgamingzone dot org&gt;</i><br>
</small>

<p>
This documentation is geared towards the configuration of grubby
and basic understanding of its structure. For further reading,
the Grubby User Manual and the Grubby Architecture Manual are available.
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
Grubby consists of the binary "grubby", the perl script "grubby-config", and
many plugins (shared libraries). There are two groups of plugins: core modules,
of which only one can be active at a time (to be determined at program startup),
and normal modules, of which none to all can be loaded, and even unloaded and
reloaded at runtime. Additionally, some scripts are available to be executed
with either the <tt>embed</tt> or <tt>exec</tt> module, and then some data
files and translated message catalogs.
Everything should install fine.
</p>

<p>
All you have to do then is to call grubby-config, which gives you a full
default installation. You might want to cut the options down, just edit the
configuration files under $HOME/.ggz/grubby.rc.
Then launch the bot while having a ggzd or IRC server running somewhere.
If it fails, make sure you didn't cut too much options. Use netconsole.so as
<tt>net</tt> core module to test for errors not relating to network protocols.
Read docs/Setup for a full sample file, a short overview follows.
</p>

<p>
This is a minimal configuration file. By default it is expected to reside
in $HOME/.ggz/grubby.rc. Entries which start with a hash mark (#) are
optional.
<blockquote>
<pre>
[preferences]
name = Grubby # Bot name
language = en # Bot default language
autojoin = 0  # Channel/room to join after login
owner = you   # Owner nickname
host = localhost # Where to connect to
#logfile = /tmp/guruchatlog

[guru]
net = /path/to/libguru_netggz.so # or netsilc.so, netirc.so, netconsole.so
player = /path/to/libguru_player.so
i18n = /path/to/libguru_i18n.so
#modules = self people ...

[modules]
self = /path/to/libgurumod_self.so
#...
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>Network setup</h3>

<p>
Grubby can communicate with users either locally (for debugging) or being
logged into a GGZ, IRC or SILC server.
The core module <tt>net</tt> can be configured appropriately:
<ul>
<li>netggz.so
<li>netirc.so
<li>netsilc.so
<li>netconsole.so
</ul>
For autojoining a room upon login, a number or room name must be given for GGZ
(e.g. 0 or tictactoe), while IRC expects a channel with hash mark (e.g. #ggz),
and SILC expects a channel without hash mark (e.g. testroom).
The implementation netggz.so does not only provide chat, but also gaming
features, which are ignored by the other implementations.
</p>

<h3>Administrative commands</h3>

<p>
The owner of grubby, as specified in the configuration, may issue some more commands
than the other players. Here's a list of what the admin can do:
<ul>
<li>grubby insmod (modulename) - Inserts a plugin, like <tt>self</tt> or <tt>badword</tt>
<li>grubby rmmod (modulename) - Unloads a plugin
<li>grubby reload (modulename) - A combination of the above
<li>grubby modules - List all loaded plugins
<li>grubby goto (roomnumber/channelname) - Let grubby join the given room
<li>grubby log (on|off) - Control whether the bot should log messages or not
</ul>
The reload command ensures that the latest version of a module is in memory.
</p>

<h3>Log files</h3>

<p>
Grubby can be requested to log all communication to a log file.
Also, the player database at ~/.ggz/grubby/playerdb is filled with entries when
players join the room Grubby is in. These entries can be enhanced by the
players with additional information using the <tt>player</tt> core module.
</p>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<p>
Some of the available modules are documented here.
</p>

<h4>Exec module</h4>

<p>
This plugin executes external scripts and programs, writes to their stdin and reads
from their stdout. It should be noted that the more external processes are spawned
in serial order, the more time it consumes, and grubby may not react fast enough.
Whereever available, execution via the <tt>embed</tt> module or even a native plugin
(shared library) should be preferred.
</p>

<h4>Embed module</h4>

<p>
Similar to <tt>exec</tt>, save it embeds the scripts directly. This works for python,
perl and ruby so far and requires that support for those languages has been enabled
at compile time.
One advantage is that all commands are executed much faster.
</p>

<h4>Games module</h4>

<p>
Grubby has the ability to launch game clients which have no GUI when
commanded to do so. Those games are registered like normal GGZ game clients,
except that their frontend is set to 'guru'.
</p>

<h3>Scripts for the exec/embed modules</h3>

<p>
The following scripts are distributed along with grubby (but others can easily
be added). The corresponding interpreters should be installed.
</p>

<h4>News module script (rdf.pl)</h4>

<p>
Several news sites offer RDF files which contain all headlines and links to the
articles in XML format. Now when the user requests news from one of those sites,
the module first fetches the latest RDF file from the target host (needs the perl
module Net::Telnet installed), and randomly seeks one of the headlines which is to
be returned.
</p>

<h4>Dictionary module script (dict.pl)</h4>

<p>
This module is presentated by the perl script "dict.pl", which in turn needs
several dictionaries installed, or at least one of them. Under Unix, those are
mostly under /usr/share/trans/X-Y, where X and Y are lowercase language letters,
like "en" for English. The dictionary files contain key:value pairs of words.
Now when a search is done, the module simply opens the appropriate file and scans
it. In the case of inverse search, key and value are swapped. The module returns
a concatenated string which contains all translations it found for the key word.
</p>

<h4>Meeting module script (meeting.rb)</h4>

<p>
This one needs Ruby installed, preferably version 1.6+. Its configurable database
goes normally to $HOME/.ggz/grubby/meeting, similar to others. It uses an
interesting technique to store its data: Instead of writing key-value pairs,
it dumps the whole object so one can transfer it from one host to another.
</p>

<h4>Translation module script (webtranslator.sh)</h4>

<p>
In case common shell tools (cut, grep, ...) and wget are available, the script
webtranslator.sh can be used for translations. It stores translated pairs of
sentences into its cache (~/.ggz/grubby/google).
