The official GGZ Gaming Zone chat bot is known as Grubby, although it may have different names like Keeper or eurogrubby.
It has been enhanced to work with both internal and external modules, called the "guru library". This is currently work in progress,
but once the transition has been finished, it'll be worth the work. So this documentation covers all the new stuff which is not documented yet.

You can ask Grubby about the latest news world-wide. If you want him to tell you a news headline, just tell him:
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>grubby news slashdot</FONT>
<BR><BR>
The following news sources are available right now: Slashdot, Heise, The Register and Happy Penguin.

In case you don't understand a word when chatting, this might help you: It translates words from English into your native language.
In case grubby does already know where you're from, it can also do this the other way around. Here is how it goes:
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>grubby what is Tree in german</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>grubby what is Bier in fuzzy english</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Please note the use of the modifier "fuzzy" here: It'll match all words which contain the word as a substring, hence give more output to the chat.
