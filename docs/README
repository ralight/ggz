===================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - Documentation
===================================

This module contains reference documentation, tutorials and help for game
module writers. The client/server specification and a general overview are also
included.

Some documents are also published online, and may be updated from time to time.
The (rather preliminary) KDE games guide for GGZ:
	http://www.kde.org/kdegames/ggz-kde-preview.html
The external games howto:
	http://ggz.sourceforge.net/ggz-support-howto.txt

We also intend to put a detailed game help collection here, in addition to the
one which is available in the games themselves.

Have fun!
	- The GGZ Gaming Zone Development Team
