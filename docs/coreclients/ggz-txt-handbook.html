<h3>GGZ Text Client Manual</h3>

<i>Written for GGZ 0.0.9</i>

<h4>Command line options and arguments</h4>
<p>
The following options are supported:
<ul>
<li>--reverse (-r): Uses an alternative color scheme, which is useful for
terminals with white background.
<li>--version (-v): Displays version information and quits
<li>--help (-h): Shows a little help screen and quits
</ul>
The only supported argument is a valid GGZ URI to connect to, which
has the format: ggz://[user@]host[:port]. Examples would thus be:
<pre>
ggz://some.ggz.server
ggz://me@some.other.ggz.server:5688
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Startup script</h4>
<p>
A startup script can be used to execute commands automatically during the
startup of the program. For example, a user might want to connect to a server
and join a room without having to enter the commands by hand each time.
</p>
<p>
The location of the script is at ~/.ggz/ggz-txt.startup.
The example above might look like:
<pre>
/connect some.ggz.server
/join room 1
/list types
Hi there, it's me again!
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Playing games</h4>
<p>
This core client can be used like any other to play games.
If it is running in a plain console ($DISPLAY is not set), only
console game clients can be run by it, which currently only exist
for the TicTacToe game.
If it is running in a X11 environment terminal emulator, much more games are
available.
