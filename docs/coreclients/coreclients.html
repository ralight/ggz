<p>
Core clients enable players to log into GGZ servers, chat, select a game
for play or spectating, view the network lag and handle numerous smaller
tasks.
Hence, they are an essential part of GGZ and their internals should be
well understood.
A core client <a href="corefeatures.html">feature comparison matrix</a>
is aiding in finding out which clients provide which functionality.
</p>

<h3>The programmes themselves</h3>

<p>
Basically, each core client starts out as a chat client. It offers
connection profiles for each server. The server list can be maintained
by hand or updated via the GGZ metaserver. Connection options include
the type of login (as a guest, registered player or for the first time),
the encryption, and of course the nickname.
</p>

<p>
After having logged in, the core client will enter the first room,
called the Entry Room or Lounge. It doesn't have any games associated
with it so only chatting is possible. Within each room, players can
view their peers and their properties (including privilege status,
buddy list status and game statistics). They also can start a private
conversation, check their connection lag, and talk with the chatbot,
for which a visual dialog might exist.
</p>

<p>
Entering a regular room opens the possibility of launching a table,
with a predefined number of open and reserved seats and AI players.
Existing tables can also be joined, either as player or as spectator.
Then, directly linked to the join is the launch of the local game
module which will then communicate with the game server.
Core clients still handle tasks like transmitting the player list,
highscores and so on.
</p>

<p>
A core client lets some privileged users perform additional actions.
GGZ differentiates into admins, hosts, regular registered users,
registered bots and guest users.
Hosts can make other players be quiet or kick them from the server
if they behave badly. They can also chat in private at tables while
they're playing, which is forbidden for non-privileged players.
Administrators can do all that and in addition
modify the permissions of registered players so that new hosts or
administrators can be created.
The first set of actions is called "admin actions", the second one
"player permission management".
</p>

<h3>Existing core clients</h3>

<p>
Regular GGZ core clients present themselves online at the
<a href="http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/clients/">core client homepages</a>.
This includes KGGZ, GGZ-Gtk and GGZ-Gnome for typical Linux desktops running
e.g. KDE, GNOME or XFCE, GGZ-Java for any desktop or usage as an applet on
webpages and Víbora for full-screen environments.
It also includes ggz-txt for text console users such as found alot
among GGZ developers.
Beside the regular GGZ core clients, some special clients exist.
The first group of special core clients includes include all programs which
behave a bit different from regular core clients but nevertheless use
the same technical base. This group includes Grubby (the chatbot),
TelGGZ, the Telnet wrapper for GGZ, and GGZap and ggz-wrapper which
are tools for launching GGZ games quickly. GGZap is a graphical tool
for KDE, whereas ggz-wrapper is a command-line tool used by the instant
messenger plugins for Pidgin (formerly Gaim) and Kopete.
The second group of special core clients are games which run in
"embedded mode". Those are games which not only can be
launched by other core clients, but they connect to GGZ servers
themselves! Of course in most cases they won't have all the features
that regular core clients have, but the advantage is that one can
launch a network game right away from the application menu.
It is considered good habit to support both launching from core clients
and running in "embedded mode" at the same time at least for larger games.
The GGZ Game Development Guide has more information on that topic.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the following core clients exist:
<ul>
<li>Regular core clients: KGGZ, GGZ-Gtk, GGZ-Gnome, GGZ-Java, ggz-txt
<li>Special core clients: Grubby, TelGGZ, GGZap, ggz-wrapper, ggz-cmd
<li>Games running in "embedded mode"
</ul>
</p>

<h3>A building block: ggzcore</h3>

<p>
The ggzcore library has been written to support the development of
core clients. It is currently used in the regular clients
as well as in the special clients and games which run in "embedded mode".
However, not all of those use ggzcore directly, which is written in
C and therefore mainly used by C programmers.
Wrappers exist for C++ (called GGZCore++) and Python (called
PyGGZCoreSimple). GGZCore++ is used by KGGZ and GGZap, and
PyGGZCoreSimple is used by Víbora, the Pygame/SDL core client.
In addition, GGZ-Java provides its own reimplementation of ggzcore.
It is not yet offered as a library but usable as a package
under the name ggz.client.core.
An overview about the ggzcore library and its counterparts for
other programming languages is given on its
<a href="http://dev.ggzgamingzone.org/libraries/ggzcore/">developer homepage</a>.
The overview includes links to API documentation if available.
</p>

<p>
The following text is a guide on how to use ggzcore.
It sort of represents a tutorial which at some later point will be
moved to its own document.
</p>

<p>
Initialising ggzcore is always the first step and performed with
<tt>ggzcore_init</tt>. There are a few options which can be combined
to tune the library behaviour:
<ul>
<li>GGZ_OPT_PARSER activates the configuration file parser. This option is
not used right now but might be so in the future.
<li>GGZ_OPT_MODULES loads the game module database, which in most cases
is desired.
<li>GGZ_OPT_THREADED_IO enables asynchronous hostname lookups for the
initial server connection, to ensure that no single operation in ggzcore
blocks the application. This is highly experimental and depends on the
appropriate asynchronous operations in libggz.
<li>GGZ_OPT_EMBEDDED is for core clients which shall only start a single
game, and do so without launching an external process but consider themselves
the game. Put the other way around, it is a game which comes with an integrated
core client ("embedded games"). An example for this is Widelands.
<li>GGZ_OPT_RECONNECT enables automatic reconnection in case the connection
breaks. This is also experimental, and especially will not restore
any running game yet.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The way ggzcore works is that it maps the entities to
object-orientated structures and functions. Thus, after initialising
the library with <tt>ggzcore_init</tt>, the first action will always
be to initialise a server "object" by calling <tt>ggzcore_server_new</tt>.
Afterwards, some variables may be set, like the hostname, but
before actually connecting, callbacks must be set up because ggzcore
works callback-based all the way. This can be done with
<tt>ggzcore_server_add_event_hook</tt>. Examples of such hooks are
GGZ_CONNECTED, when the connection is first established, or
GGZ_LOGIN_FAIL, if the subsequent login did not succeed.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="ggzcore_server.png" alt="Server and rooms relation">
</p>

<p>
As can bee seen in the picture, the server hosts a lot of rooms.
The room list can be fetched by calling <tt>ggzcore_server_list_rooms</tt>,
for which the event GGZ_ROOM_LIST will asynchronously be generated
later on. The client can then change the room, this is what
<tt>ggzcore_server_join_room</tt> is for.
</p>

<p>
In order to prepare gaming, the gametype associated to each room must be
known also. As for the room list, the list of gametypes will arrive
upon calling <tt>ggzcore_server_list_gametypes</tt>. Usually, this is
even performed before joining any room, but to speed up things it could
also be done afterwards in the background.
</p>

<p>
Just like a <tt>GGZServer</tt> object represents the server, the room
the player has joined is accessible via a <tt>GGZRoom</tt> object, which
can always conveniently be retrieved as the result of the function
<tt>ggzcore_server_get_cur_room</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Chatting</h3>

<p>
After entering a room, the players will likely see a visual list of
players, passed to the client by <tt>ggzcore_room_get_nth_player</tt>.
A message can be sent to all of them by calling <tt>ggzcore_room_chat</tt>
with a chat type of GGZ_CHAT_NORMAL. Likewise, using GGZ_CHAT_BEEP and
GGZ_CHAT_PERSONAL send a beep or a message to a selected player,
respectively. Administrative broadcasts are possible with GGZ_CHAT_ANNOUNCE.
However, in order to receive all the chat messages, the room hooks
must be set up just like the server hooks were, which is the task
of <tt>ggzcore_room_add_event_hook</tt>.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to chat with a subgroup of people who are playing
on the same table. In order to get that far, a closer look at how games
are launched must be done first.
</p>

<h3>Playing games</h3>

<p>
The gametype associated with each room must be supported by at least
one game client, but there can also be multiple frontends for each game.
The way a launch works, a <tt>GGZTable</tt> object is built first with
<tt>ggzcore_table_new</tt>, and its seats are configured by the launching
player, who is also known as game host, as opposed to the other players
who will join later on.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="ggzcore_room.png" alt="Tables and players in a room">
</p>

<p>
The core client will then move the players to the table, and out
of the list of players who are not on any table.
During the game, it keeps the connection to the game client using
several functions of the ggzcore library, so when a game requests
statistics, for instance, it will relay this request to the main server
(ggzd), read the statistics, and forward them to the game client again.
This helps to keep the game protocols small, since all the common
data exchanges can be done via GGZ. The same goes for game and team
chat.
</p>

<h3>The launch in detail</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="playing.png" alt="Launching table and game">
</p>

<p>
The way from wanting to play a game to actually playing it is very complex.
It consists of two parts, table launch and game launch, where the first
part only applies to the first player, as all others can simply join
the table.
</p>

<p>
It is important to know when to start reading data from the game module's
control file descriptor and when to stop it again - at this time the
game will already be set to the PLAYING state and the core client has
mostly done its duty.
