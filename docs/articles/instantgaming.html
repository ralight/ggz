<H2>GGZ Instant Gaming</H2>
<I>Josef Spillner, 14.04.2002</I>
<BR><BR>

This article describes a game launch using a GGZ Gaming Zone server, without
requiring a traditional GGZ client.
It is therefore a concept which can be implemented by game authors for games
which do, for example, have a long history of being launched on their own, so
the players don't have to learn a new program.
This will be referred to as GGZ Instant Gaming in this article.
Note that the use of a GGZ client like kggz or ggz-gtk is still recommended.
<BR><BR>

All communication is done via an XML protocol. The current GGZ protocol has the
version number 6, and is not stabilized yet.
The game author should use proven functionality for the XML parsing, for
example by using expat or qxmlreader, whatever is appropriate.
<BR><BR>

Let's start. The game connects to a GGZ server (a method of doing so, using a
connection dialog or automatic connection via meta servers, must be provided by
the game itself).
It is presented with a 'welcome string', which consists of the opening
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SESSION</FONT> tag and the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SERVER</FONT>
identification which has <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">OPTION</FONT>s like the maximum chat
length.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;SESSION&gt;<BR>
&lt;SERVER ID='GGZ-0.0.5' NAME='An Unconfigured GGZ Server' VERSION='6' STATUS='ok'&gt;<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;OPTIONS CHATLEN='512'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;/SERVER&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

The game client can now log in. This is done by replying with a correct XML
header, and opening the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">SESSION</FONT> from the client
side, followed by the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LOGIN</FONT> attempt. This contains
the player's <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">NAME</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
PASSWORD</FONT> when playing as registered user (which is not required).
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='ISO-8859-1'?&gt;<BR>
&lt;SESSION&gt;<BR>
&lt;LOGIN TYPE='guest'&gt;<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;NAME&gt;josef&lt;/NAME&gt;<BR>
&lt;/LOGIN&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

If the login succeeds, the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RESULT</FONT> returns code zero,
and the message of the day (<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">MOTD</FONT>) is sent. The login
procedure is then finished, and the game client can proceed with further action.
Otherwise, either a player with this name is already logged in, or this is a
registered name. See the GGZ protocol documentation for detailed information on
the return codes.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;RESULT ACTION='login' CODE='0'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;MOTD PRIORITY='normal'&gt;<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;![CDATA[No MOTD today!]]&gt;<BR>
&lt;/MOTD&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

Now the game requests information about the available rooms, and the installed game servers.
It does so by sending the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LIST</FONT> command, which
contains room and game as list types. In the example, a full listing is issued,
which returns all available information. This is not strictly necessary, but
useful in most cases.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
&lt;LIST TYPE='room' FULL='true'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;LIST TYPE='game' FULL='true'/&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

Each list command is answered by a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RESULT</FONT> block,
which, in this case, contains (surprise) a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LIST</FONT>.
The room list contains all the available <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ROOM</FONT>s,
which by now only reveal a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DESC</FONT>ription, beside the
game name and the room id. The latter one is important to match the id
of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GAME</FONT> entries in the game list. Each game is
identified by a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PROTOCOL</FONT>, which itself consists of
the protocol engine and the protocol version. Both of these must actually match
the one of the game client in order to be able to play. A game
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DESC</FONT>ription is also sent, along with the number of
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ALLOW</FONT>ed players and bots, and further information
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ABOUT</FONT> the game.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;RESULT ACTION='list' CODE='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;LIST TYPE='room'&gt;<BR>
&lt;ROOM ID='0' NAME='Entry Room' GAME='-1'&gt;<BR>
&lt;DESC&gt;A place to meet and choose a game room&lt;/DESC&gt;<BR>
&lt;/ROOM&gt;<BR>
&lt;ROOM ID='1' NAME='Chess' GAME='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;DESC&gt;Example Chess Room&lt;/DESC&gt;<BR>
&lt;/ROOM&gt;<BR>
&lt;/LIST&gt;<BR>
...<BR>
&lt;/RESULT&gt;<BR>
<BR><BR>
&lt;RESULT ACTION='list' CODE='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;LIST TYPE='game'&gt;<BR>
&lt;GAME ID='0' NAME='Chess' VERSION='0.0.6'&gt;<BR>
&lt;PROTOCOL ENGINE='Chess' VERSION='2'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;ALLOW PLAYERS='2' BOTS='0'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;ABOUT AUTHOR='Ismael Orenstein' URL='http://ggz.sourceforge.net/games/chess/'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;DESC&gt;GGZ game module for playing Chess&lt;/DESC&gt;<BR>
&lt;/GAME&gt;<BR>
&lt;/LIST&gt;<BR>
...<BR>
&lt;/RESULT&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

The game client is now ready to <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ENTER</FONT> one room. It
will then show up in the player list of every GGZ client, so GGZ Instant Gaming
should not use well-known public servers. However, for the beginning, it is
sufficient to add a signature like '/xxx' to the player name (which is allowed
to be 16 chars long), just like GGZap does with appending '/zap'.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
&lt;ENTER ROOM='0'/&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

In the example, we entered the first room, which is usually the lounge.
Success is indicated by the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RESULT</FONT>. The
lounge doesn't have a game associated with it, and entering it invokes a server
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">CHAT</FONT> message.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;RESULT ACTION='enter' CODE='0'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;CHAT TYPE='private' FROM='[Server]'&gt;<BR>
&lt;![CDATA[You are the only player currently logged in.]]&gt;<BR>
&lt;/CHAT&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

We are then, maybe, interested in a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LIST</FONT> of
players currently logged in, and of all the launched tables. Each table
represents one running game, and has the players on it which take part in this
game.
Note that most games won't enter the lounge, but rather go to their room
directly. For documentation purpose we will however handle this here.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
&lt;LIST TYPE='player'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;LIST TYPE='table'/&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

Now the server lets us know the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RESULT</FONT> of our
query. It sends a <FONT COLOR=#0000FF>LIST</FONT> of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PLAYER
</FONT>s, and an empty list for the tables, which would contain a bunch of
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">TABLE</FONT>s if there were some running games.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;RESULT ACTION='list' CODE='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;LIST TYPE='player' ROOM='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;PLAYER ID='josef' TYPE='guest' TABLE='-1' LAG='1'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;/LIST&gt;<BR>
&lt;/RESULT&gt;<BR>
<BR><BR>
&lt;RESULT ACTION='list' CODE='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;LIST TYPE='table' ROOM='0'&gt;<BR>
&lt;/LIST&gt;<BR>
&lt;/RESULT&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

Now, the game client <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ENTER</FONT>s a room which
contains its game type. The server reply is similar to the one above, and has
therefore been cut here.
Instead, one of the few cases where a server initiates a part of the
communication can occur everytime during the login: A <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PING
</FONT>...
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;PING/&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

... which must be answered with a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">PONG</FONT>
immideately. The player lag calculation takes the time difference as its base,
and it may very well be that in the future players with a too high lag are
logged out.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
&lt;PONG/&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

So much for the prerequesites. If this is done, the game client may start a
game. It does so by issuing a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LAUNCH</FONT> command,
which should create a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">TABLE</FONT>. (Technically, the
game is then started automatically on the server side.)
A table may contain a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DESC</FONT>ription, which is empty
in the example, and a chain of <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">SEAT</FONT> tags, each of
them telling about a certain seat. In the beginning they're all empty.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
&lt;LAUNCH&gt;<BR>
&lt;TABLE GAME='12' SEATS='2'&gt;<BR>
&lt;DESC&gt;&lt;/DESC&gt;<BR>
&lt;SEAT NUM='0' TYPE='open'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;SEAT NUM='1' TYPE='open'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<BR>
&lt;/LAUNCH&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

The table launch is then broadcasted to all clients, including the one which
issued it. This information gets delivered to the clients by an
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UPDATE</FONT> bock, which contains the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
TABLE</FONT>, holding all the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SEAT</FONT>s.
The player itself is placed into the first open seat.
This too is broadcasted with an <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UPDATE</FONT> tag, which
specifies the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">TABLE</FONT> in question, and the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SEAT</FONT> of the player.
All other seats can either be open too, which means the game is not full yet, or a bot,
or a seat reserved for a specific player.
Before the player gets his seat, however, the game was launched, and this is
indicated with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RESULT</FONT> tag between the other
events.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;UPDATE TYPE='table' ACTION='add' ROOM='13'&gt;<BR>
&lt;TABLE ID='0' GAME='12' STATUS='1' SEATS='2'&gt;<BR>
&lt;DESC&gt;&lt;/DESC&gt;<BR>
&lt;SEAT NUM='0' TYPE='open'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;SEAT NUM='1' TYPE='open'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<BR>
&lt;/UPDATE&gt;<BR>
<BR><BR>
&lt;RESULT ACTION='launch' CODE='0'/&gt;<BR>
&lt;UPDATE TYPE='table' ACTION='join' ROOM='13'&gt;<BR>
&lt;TABLE ID='0' SEATS='2'&gt;<BR>
&lt;SEAT NUM='0' TYPE='player'&gt;josef&lt;/SEAT&gt;<BR>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<BR>
&lt;/UPDATE&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

If a player tries to get into a game, a game server could still refuse him, so
a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RESULT</FONT> is also generated for this event.
Again, a code zero means success.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;RESULT ACTION='join' CODE='0'/&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

Upon start, either the game server or the game client sends out initial data.
This is either tunneled by GGZ using a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DATA</FONT> tag
containing some XML CDATA, or exchanged directly by the game client and server,
whatever method is implemented.
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&lt;DATA SIZE='21'&gt;<BR>
&lt;![CDATA[0 0 0 17 75 68 69 32 77 117 101 104 108 101 32 71 97 109 101 10 0 ]]&gt;<BR>
&lt;/DATA&gt;<BR>
</FONT><BR><BR>

That's it. A game could be running in this state. In order to leave, simply
disconnecting is enough, the GGZ server does then take care of everything.
