How to internationalize GGZ
---------------------------

The GGZ Gaming Zone is a truly international project. Its contributors range
from America to Europe, from the frosty North to the warm South. In order to
let everyone participate as easy as possible, translation is probably among the
most important parts.

This document is neither complete nor do I have a plan how to complete it - but
it contains some usefule ideas which some people have assembled over the past
months.

GGZ-KDE-Client: We have KGGZ internationalized under kde-client/ggz-kde/po, all
other apps are not yet i18n'd. Whenever you plan an translation update, please
call "make messages-update" in this directory first. Before that, please make
sure you call "make messages" in the following order:
1. in src/widgets/
2. in src/
If a language hasn't been created yet, you only need to copy kggz.pot to
<cc>.po, and add it to po/Makefile.am.

GGZ-Gtk-Games: This is very easy. Every game and every language form a matrix.
Please have a look at po/*, it should be self-explanatory. If you write a new
game, please add it to SUBDIRS (although that may even be abolished). Languages
are then recognized automatically.
The games may have different concepts of adding gettext support - right now the
TicTacToe and Hastings games show how that can easily be done via ggzintl.c.

Documentation: Feel free to translate as you like - we will be thankful for
every bit! Especially for docs which have yet to be written ;)

Other packages: No i18n yet, but this will change. Please hold on.
