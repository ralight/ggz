The required security and privacy rules for GGZ
===============================================

These are the rules which should apply within a few months, as soon as all the
possibilities are available. We consider privacy and security to have a very
high priority.
Maybe it is wise to split into a "concept" and an "implementation" part, so
coming applications can adapt the concepts more easily, and other projects can
follow the guidelines too and improve them where necessary.
It should always be stressed that there isn't total security, but that we try
our best to support all possible concepts, so that negative cases don't affect
the project in a negative way, but rather encourage for researching even harder.

What people have learned from the past months is that some online game
providers didn't care about personal data - not only didn't protect they the
information, but they also abused it. In many cases people are forced to take
some steps of registration, which is clearly against what is considered to be
free fun. Also, it is clear that more and more governments have high interest in
undergoing the constitutions, so the right to express own opinions should
always be given and the players should be safe to do so, everywhere in the
world.

These are the suggestion of the rules. They are by no means fixed yet, so
comments are as always appreciated. Once this list is "stable", it'll be always
available in the documentation package.

1. Anonymous players
Every player should stay anonymous unless he wishes that to change. This
affects the following:
- Login: Guest logins shouldn't have unnecessary disadvantages
- Registered logins as protection for the player to prevent fakers
- Direct IP exchange: The Core Client should always warn users if a game
  requests the client's IP - and client-to-client games should be avoided
  generally, but they seem necessary for fast games
- Buddy list: This list isn't mandatory
- Personal information: Always confirm before passing that to another client

2. Chat security
- Use TLS tunneling whereever possible
- Don't let the Core Clients execute local programs
- let both grubby and the server tell whether they log or not
- Flood protection etc. must be handled by ggzd to avoid traffic
- Never put chat log files online, except the participants agree, e.g. for
  developer meetings
- People who troll should be ignored. People who do forbidden or criminal
  actions should be out-locked, if other players are annoyed by that.

3. Stored data
- For competition etc. it may be necessary to store an email address, and
  furthermore the delivery address of players. This information should,
  whenever possible, be kept outside of the server, and/or deleted as soon as
  it isn't required anymore.
- Anonymous data like interests or favorite games are preferably handled by the
  clients, unless otherwise wanted by the player

4. Servers, trusted network
- Only the source provided by the GGZ Gaming Zone development team is
  considered trusted; binary packages are a convenience solution
- malicios servers are to be ignored for the network of trust
- always provide an abuse contact for both players and server hosters so the
  problems can be faced.
- There should be the possibility to reconfigure ggzd at runtime, like a
  "reload" of the configuration, which is important for network blacklists etc.
- Use some kind of ACL for the meta server information, to not let bad hosts
  get their listing in them

5. Display
- always let the Core Client display whether the current state is secure or
  insecure
- provide more accurate log files

6. Buzzwords
Maybe someone has more ideas when reading the following:
- trust
- security
- privacy
- freedom
