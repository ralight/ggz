%% TODO: /usr/include/ggz, $GGZWRAPPER, "best of GGZ"/graveyard split (e.g. ggzgnome, netspades)
%% TODO: buildsystem as per RFC

For the general development topics of GGZ, please have a look at:
http://dev.ggzgamingzone.org/
Not only programming tasks, but also the "big other three" (translations,
artwork and documentation) are introduced on that site.

To find current issues, three main sources of information exist:
- TODO files to find out about plans for additions or heavy changes
- https://bugs.ggzgamingzone.org/ for user-reported bugs
- as well as FIXME/TODO/XXX comments in the source code for obvious bugs

As soon as the development has more stabilized, this file will carry more
detailed information about each sub project.
For the time being, ask on the GGZ development mailing list
(ggz-dev@mail.ggzgamingzone.org) to get to know where developers or helpers
are needed. The answer won't surprise you - they're always needed!

The roadmap below lists important changes which are currently postponed for
the planned release of GGZ 1.0 so that development and packaging will not be
interrupted constantly.

===========================
Towards GGZ Gaming Zone 1.0
===========================

Status and timeline
-------------------

This is really just a draft. Due to discussion of all of the items, changes
may occur over time, and the schedule might become more clear or more vague
accordingly.

The changes directly related to 1.0 will take about half a year to one year
alone. It is suggested to bump the version number from 0.0.x to 0.99.x
in advance, with 0.99.0 being a first try and further releases mostly
focusing on packaging and polishing tasks. Those releases should probably
have a snapshot character, and not be downloaded by users except for maybe
one of them.
Finally, 1.0-beta will be unleashed, with 1.0 following soon thereafter if
everything works ok.

No prospective date for the start of the 0.99.0 development cycle has been
proposed yet. It might happen in early 2007, though.

Goals and perspectives
----------------------

The goals to achieve before being able to declare GGZ to be 1.0 shall include:
- widely used by a lot of gamers, and known through articles and presentations
- availability on most major Linux distributions and BSDs
- acceptable translation status of client applications
- increased use by external game authors

External circumstances
----------------------

KDE 4 will be released in early 2007, it seems. This will affect both
ggz-kde-client and ggz-kde-games. Porting work will require many many hours.

The open-sourcing process of Java might make it useful to add system
integration to the ggz-java package, like menu entries or the ability
to launch native game clients (and vice-versa, the ability to launch
java game clients from native core clients).

Packaging layout
----------------

The number of GGZ packages, which as the time of writing is 16, should be
reduced a bit. The following changes appear to make sense:
- merging libggz, ggz-client-libs and several of the static libraries into
  a common ggz-libraries package
- moving ggz-txt-client into the ggz-utils package
- dropping ggz-gnome-client, unless development proceeds
  (effectively moving ggz-gnome and motd_editor into playground)
This will result in 13 packages overall.

Candidates for ggz-libraries are ggzchess, ggzmeta and ttt-ai.
The package layout will be such that the top-level directories be named
'base', 'clients', 'games' and 'misc'.

Application and library changes
-------------------------------

Several changes might be ahead, have a look at the TODO files!
Listing them here would outdate the roadmap regularly.
But it is important to know that many development efforts are still necessary.
