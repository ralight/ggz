For the current roadmap of GGZ, please have a look at:
http://ggz.sourceforge.net

There's also a news item telling about important discussion about which parts
of the project should have what priority.

As soon as the development has more stabilized, this file will carry more
detailed information about each sub project.
For the time being, ask on the GGZ development mailing list
(ggz-dev@lists.sourceforge.net) to get to know where developers or helpers are needed.
The answer won't surprise you - they're always needed!
