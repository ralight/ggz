The GGZ Gaming Zone Build System
--------------------------------

GGZ uses the GNU autotools to guarantee maximum availability on all system
which provide interfaces compliant to or similar to POSIX.

This includes:
- autoconf (with autoheader)
- automake (with aclocal)
- libtool (with libtoolize)

Other components which are almost always needed are:
- perl
- gettext

To easy the life for the GGZ developers, the file acinclude.ggz has been
written which checks for a proper environment for both GGZ programs and
external programs using GGZ libraries.

The following macros are relevant:

AC_GGZ_INIT
  Initializes the build system. This is not strictly necessary, but includes
  some search directories by default which would otherwise have to be specified
  by the user.
  It takes no arguments by default, but understands two of them:
  * defaults
    Adds a bunch standard paths for headers, libraries and binaries to the
    search path
  * export
    The default search path is made available to external checks

AC_GGZ_LIBGGZ
AC_GGZ_GGZCORE
AC_GGZ_GGZMOD
AC_GGZ_GGZDMOD
  Searches the GGZ libraries. Both header file and shared library must be
  present in order to be accepted.
  Those values are cached, so config.cache must be removed upon recheck.
  It takes no arguments by default, but will bail out if a library is not
  found. This can be prevented by giving an argument:
  * ignore
    Tells about the error, and leaves it to the configure.in check to further
    decide what to do.

AC_GGZ_INTL
  Sets up standard tools for internationalization.
  Takes no arguments.
