The preferred format of CVS sources for GGZ
-------------------------------------------

This is not meant as a requirement, rather as a hint or guideline.

In order to raise the quality of both source and binary packages,
CVS modules (which mostly represent packages) should follow some
rules.

A common directory called "man" which contains man pages should be present.
Build sources for both Debian and RPM backages, most likely in the form
of a "debian" subdirectory and a "<packagename>.spec" file, enable that
these packages can be built on-the-fly.

Documentation should not be contained in the modules themselves, because
we have a documentation module. However, small texts and such can of course
be included.

Sources should be used in a shared way. For example, the M4 macros to detect
the GGZ libraries and tools, or the i18n stuff. If there are differences, it
should be discussed which way to go, or one should find a compromise.

We encourage everybody to contribute. If a directory contains really unstable
sources, feel free to add it though (or let someone add it), because it can be
excluded from the default build and enabled with ./configure --enable-unstable
or similar techniques.

Nobody has to mess around with configuration. You can safely concentrate on
the coding itself, there are always friendly people who help with setting
things up in an environment-independent way.

Please provide readme files. The global readme is called README.GGZ and is
included in all directories. All major applications should get their own
files inside a module.

Don't feel annoyed by these rules. They can be changed everytime if something
is odd.
