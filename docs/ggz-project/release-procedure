This is a summary of common tasks when rolling out a release.
It should be understood as advice, which is backed by previous experience.

Quite some time before release
------------------------------
* update documentation.
  This includes both the docs/ module in all its glory, as well as manpages and
  individual program documentation.
* check TODO files
* regression tests: anything gotten worse since last release?
* update translations (i18n), see separate document 'Internationalization'
* inform 3rd party game authors
* hunt bugs, keep the number of new ones low
* organize game blitzes

Directly before release
-----------------------
* update build instruction.
  Affected files are README.GGZ and QuickStart.GGZ.
  Does 'make distcheck' work?
* update NEWS and README
* bump version numbers
  Protocol version numbers should be controlled by
  /docs/games/game-development/games.html
* update toplevel ChangeLog files with CVS history
* inform distributors
* update permanent stable game servers
  Currently, this is ggz.snafu.de.
  Also, the metaserver should contain an entry for the previous version,
  pointing to a convenience host.

During release
--------------
* tag CVS with symbolic tag 'ggz-x-y-z'
* create and upload source tarballs
* web site synchronization
  The release announcement as well as several common files should be updated.
  This includes the QuickStart and README.GGZ files, and everything under
  docs/.
* announce on various game-related websites
  Examples are happypenguin.org, linuxgames.com, SF games foundry, holarse.net,
  freshmeat.
* find some time to actually play one of our games once, celebrating the release

After release
-------------
* Check each and every problem
* Update roadmap, decide which playground stuff goes gold next time
