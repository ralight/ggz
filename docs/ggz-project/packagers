Information for packagers
=========================

It has been argued that GGZ is hard to install. It certainly wasn't trivial
in early versions, but is very easy nowadays. This file contains useful
information about how to package GGZ. Most of it relates to GGZ's own set
of autoconf macros. For detailed information on them, have a look at the
'buildsystem' file.
Also, see 'ggz-dependencies' to see how GGZ packages interact and depend
on other software.

General information
-------------------

Most of GGZ can be packaged. Out of the 16 packages we currently release,
only ggz-java and ggz-community are not yet prepared. It is expected that
sooner or later, this will change, but for now 14 packages will make up
a complete GGZ installations.

In most cases, distributors will opt for a higher number due to some
splitting. Popular are separate libraries and header packages, and the
server package actually contains the server, game servers and libraries.

Most packages are straight-forward: configure, make, make install. The game
client packages however are registered centrally by the 'ggz-config' utility.
Binary packages of them need 3 extra lines, explained below in the paragraph
about directories.

Finally, once GGZ packaging is done, check to see if any other games in
the distribution provide GGZ support! Information about those is available
from http://dev.ggzgamingzone.org/external/.
In most cases, they can be recompiled (repackaged) with --enable-ggz=true.

Directory layout
----------------

Let's look at the following standard layouts:

case | game module | registry          | use case
-----+-------------+-------------------+---------------
(1)  | /usr        | /usr              | normal installation
(2)  | /opt/kde    | /usr              | different paths for some packages
(3)  | /home       | ---               | additional GGZ games into $HOME
(4)  | /usr        | (/usr) noregistry | binary packages

Case (1) is simple. GGZ will find its libraries and tools like ggz-config
in /usr/lib and /usr/bin and, since the configured package also goes there,
everything is fine.

Case (2) is used by some distributors. Normally, if the prefix of the package
differs from the prefix of ggz-client-libs (i.e. the game module registry),
the registry is ignored. But since GGZ 0.0.14, if --with-ggzconfig is given
explicitely, it is still used nevertheless!

Case (3) is a user installing a GGZ-enabled game into his or her home
directory. Needless to say that game information cannot be installed globally
in this scenario. This is why in case (2), the explicit option is necessary.

Case (4) is somewhat orthogonal to the others. If --enable-noregistry=DIR is
given to the configure script, ggz-config is altered to behave differently.
Note: Case (2) still needs --with-ggzconfig in this case!
The module.dsc files are copied to DIR so at package installation
or removal time, the games can be mass-registered or mass-unregistered.
This happens with a call to ggz-config, but instead of giving it a module.dsc
file as its parameter, give it --noregistry=DIR.
Usually this is placed into post-installation and pre-removal scripts or
sections of the packaging file.
