This is a first guide on how to package the basic GGZ packages.
Advanced topics like python, chatbot, web interface, ... come later :)
Also, future development will be handled in a separate document,
including ggzmod/ggzcore interdependencies and common game libraries.

This is for GGZ 0.0.11. Note that the ggzcore->ggzmod dependency
has turned around into a ggzmod->ggzcore dependency!
Also, games do not require ggz-config anymore at compilation time:
if it's not present, ggz-config is simply not called.

Base Libraries
==============

libggz: needed by ggzmod and ggzcore
        needed by (some) game clients
        needed by (many) game servers

ggzmod: needed by (most) game clients
        needed by wrappers (like pyggzmod)
        depends on libggz
        depends on ggzcore

ggzdmod: needed by (most) game servers
         needed by ggzd
         depends on libggz

ggzcore: needed by ggz-config
         needed by core clients
         needed by embedded games (like widelands)
         needed by wrappers (like pyggzcoresimple)
         needed by ggzmod
         depends on libggz
         depends on ggzmod (static-only)

Base binaries
=============

ggz-config: needed for game installation - not at runtime
            depends on ggzcore

ggz-wrapper: needed for external clients - only at runtime (like IM plugins)
             depends on ggzcore

Packaging guide
===============

(Package names are symbolic and do not include sonames here.)
(The lib* prefix has been omitted to match the original names.)

libggz: packages libggz and libggz-dev
        libggz-dev depends on libggz (trivial)

ggz-client-libs: packages ggzcore, ggzcore-dev, ggzmod, ggzmod-dev, ggzcore-bin
                 ggzcore-dev depends on ggzcore (trivial)
                 ggzmod-dev depends on ggzmod (trivial)
                 ggzmod depends on ggzcore
                 ggzmod-dev depends on ggzcore-dev
                 ggzcore depends on libggz
                 ggzmod depends on libggz

*-client: package names gtk-client, kde-client, txt-client, gnome-client
          depends on ggzcore

*-games: package names ggz-gtk-games, ggz-kde-games, ggz-sdl-games,
                       ggz-kde-game-data, ggz-gtk-game-data, ggz-sdl-game-data
         ggz-*-games depends on ggzmod
         ggz-*-games pre-depends on ggzcore-bin (install only (postinst))
         ggz-gtk-games depends on ggz-gtk-game-data
         ggz-kde-games depends on ggz-kde-game-data
         ggz-sdl-games depends on ggz-sdl-game-data

ggzd: packages ggz-server, ggzdmod, ggzdmod-dev, ggz-game-servers
      ggzdmod-dev depends on ggzdmod (trivial)
      ggz-server depends on ggzdmod
      ggz-game-servers depends on ggzdmod

Package relationships
=====================

(Everything except for strict dependencies.)

ggz-*-games: recommends ggz-*-client
ggz-*-client: suggests ggz-*-games
ggz-server: recommends ggz-game-servers
ggz-game-servers: recommends ggz-server

Conclusions
===========

Installing a core client pulls in:
 the core client itself, plus ggzcore, plus ggzmod, plus libggz
Installing a game client pulls in:
 the game client itself, plus ggzmod, plus libggz, plus ggzcore-bin
Installing the server pulls in:
 the server, plus ggzdmod
Installing a game server pulls in:
 the game servers, plus ggzdmod

The IM plugins only make sense with games installed, at which point
ggzcore-bin is available, thus it makes sense to put ggz-wrapper in there
together with ggz-config.

The above is a plain 0.0.11 structure.
The goal is to have as few source diversions as possible.

Rationale for the ggz-config change:

This can be achieved by modifying configure.ac and (possibly) Makefile.am's.
(A trick to avoid the latter is setting $(GGZ_CONFIG) to /bin/true in configure.ac.)
The configure.ac modification would be:
- modify call to AC_GGZ_CONFIG("true", ignore)
- modify ggz.m4 file to set ggzmoduleconfdir, ggzexecmoddir, ggzdatadir to
  values based on prefix ($sysconfroot, $prefix/lib/ggz, $prefix/share/ggz)
  if ggz-config is not found and "ignore" is used
  (I think ggzd does something similar for 3rd party game servers.)
This is a useful change for upstream too.

Rationale for the ggzmod<->ggzcore change:
