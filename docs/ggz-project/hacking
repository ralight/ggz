GGZ Hacking Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the apprentice and the master alike...

Getting started
---------------
* checkout trunk
* copy playground/maintenance/ggzbuild to trunk
* copy ggzbuildrc.sample from same dir to ~/.ggzbuildrc (and modify as needed)
* cd trunk; ./ggzbuild -> all of GGZ will be built and installed!

Debugging
---------
* always compile without --disable-debug (check ggzbuildrc!)
* for Gtk+, setup in in ~/.ggz/ggz-gtk.rc
  [Debug]
  Types = GGZCORE:CONF GGZCORE:GAME GGZCORE:HOOK GGZCORE:MODULE GGZCORE:NET
          GGZCORE:POLL GGZCORE:ROOM GGZCORE:SERVER GGZCORE:STATE
	  GGZCORE:TABLE GGZCORE:XML
	  game modules connection servers
  (must all be on one line!)
* ggzd: always check --specs prior to anything else
* kggzmod: switch on its debug area (none assigned yet)

Coding in C
-----------
* C99 and POSIX.1-2001 are more or less a minimum requirement.
  All GGZ apps and games should be unicode-enabled.
  {platform,system}.m4 take care of all that (hopefully)
* C sucks. Watch out for more issues like largefile support...
