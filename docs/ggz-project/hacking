GGZ Hacking Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the apprentice and the master alike...

Getting started
---------------
It is recommended to use 'ggzbuild', which will build all modules in the
correct order. If you're on a new system, calling 'ggzprep' will install
all requirements beforehand if the system is recognised.

* checkout trunk
* cd trunk
* run playground/maintenance/ggzprep (on Debian, Ubuntu and maybe others)
* copy playground/maintenance/ggzbuild to trunk
* copy ggzbuildrc.sample from same dir to ~/.ggzbuildrc (and modify as needed)
* ./ggzbuild -> all of GGZ will be built and installed!

Debugging
---------
* always compile without --disable-debug (check ggzbuildrc!)
* for Gtk+, setup in ~/.ggz/ggz-gtk.rc
  [Debug]
  Types = game modules connection servers
* for ggz-txt, setup in ~/.ggz/ggz-text.rc
  [Debug]
  Types = client
* for medium-level ggzcore debugging, append the following debug types
  Types = GGZCORE:CONF GGZCORE:GAME GGZCORE:HOOK GGZCORE:MODULE GGZCORE:NET
          GGZCORE:POLL GGZCORE:ROOM GGZCORE:SERVER GGZCORE:STATE
	  GGZCORE:TABLE GGZCORE:XML
  (must all be on one line!)
* for low-level libggz debugging, append the following debug types
  Types = socket ggz_mem ggz_conf
* ggzd: always check --specs prior to anything else
* kggzmod/kggznet/kggzgames (now part of kdegames):
  switch on its debug areas (11003-11005)

Coding in C
-----------
* C99 and POSIX.1-2001 are more or less a minimum requirement.
  All GGZ apps and games should be unicode-enabled.
  {platform,system}.m4 take care of all that (hopefully)
* C sucks. Watch out for more issues like largefile support...

Coding style in C/C++
---------------------
Coding style discussions were held on ggz-dev already, but no final decision
was made yet. Where coding style comes into place already is formatting
auto-generated source code, such as network protocol handlers from GGZComm.

In order to match the unique GGZComm code production style as much as possible,
the following flags can be given to GNU indent:
-kr -i8 -nsai -nsaf -cli8 -bl -bli0

This still causes some differences which would need a better indent:
- calls of function pointers still have space between pointer and args
  (func) (arg) instead of (func)(arg)
- if statements without else and without braces still have a line break
  if(foo)\nbar(); instead of if(foo) bar();
- switch statements still have a space between switch and opening parens
  switch (foo) instead of switch(foo)
Of course, these flags would be different when formatting for the GGZ style
once such formatting is due.
