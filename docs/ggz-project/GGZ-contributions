This document lists data or source attributions to GGZ which
originate from other projects.
It should be a goal to check for proper licences and encourage
further data contributions at the same time.

The 2nd section about reused code components is important for
binary distributions. In their case, the separate copyright
statements will have to be mentioned. Otherwise, each GGZ package
is licenced under one licence, usually GPL or LGPL (for libggz,
ggz-client-libs and ggz-java), although parts of the packages can
be under different licences.
