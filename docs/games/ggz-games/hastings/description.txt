Hastings1066 - the game
-----------------------
Invented in September 2000 or so, it was the 5th game for GGZ. Unfortunately it laid lazy on my hard disk
and was only online for testing purposes. Now, the version 0.0.4 is ready for GGZ 0.0.4.

Hastings1066 features
---------------------
Up to 8 players, up to 7 of them may be AI, are playing in 2 teams against each other.
The historical background is the battle of Hastings which took part in 1066, between the English and the
Normans/French.

Some words about Hastings1066 coding
------------------------------------
1. The server sends all necessary information. This is the seat and the player configuration.
HASTINGS_MSG_SEAT passes the seat number to the client; number 0 starts playing.
HASTINGS_MSG_PLAYERS passes the number and names as well as the type (human, bot) of players to the client;
as a maximum there may be 8 players.
They are shared between 2 teams. There is no team configuration yet.
The client is now in state STATE_PREINIT.

2. A HASTINGS_REQ_INIT requests the map. As this is technically the same as syncing, the server responds with
HASTINGS_RSP_SYNC, as it would on a HASTINGS_REQ_SYNC.
The client does then switch its state from STATE_PREINIT to STATE_INIT.
The server switches to STATE_PLAYING.

3. The player whose turn it is selects a knight to move. The state is now STATE_SELECT.

4. The player sends the knight to his destination. The client's state is now STATE_MOVE.

5. The server responds: STATE_DONE finishes the move.

6. If any AI players exist, their moves are reported by the server.

7. When the game is done, the client's state changes to STATE_DONE.
No more moves are allowed then.
