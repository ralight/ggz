The Connect the Dots (CtD, or Dots) savegame format is very similar to the one
from Tic-Tac-Toe. Some differences result from the fact that the board size
is configurable. Only the moves are considered, not the claims of squares,
since most clients will have to understand and implement this association
anyway.
