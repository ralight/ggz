The Connect the Dots (CtD, or Dots) savegame format is very similar to the one
from Tic-Tac-Toe. Some differences result from the fact that the board size
is configurable. Only the moves are considered, not the claims of squares,
since most clients will have to understand and implement this association
anyway.
Game continuations are not yet really supported like in TTT!

Setup phase:
 width WIDTH
 height HEIGHT

Setup and game phase:
 playerX join PLAYERxNAME
 playerX leave PLAYERxNAME

Game phase:
 playerX move X Y (vertical|horizontal)

End of game:
 tie game
 playerX winner

Note that the KDots client up to GGZ 0.0.14 had its own, internal savegame
format. This was a legacy from the past and meanwhile it uses the format
described above. Hence it isn't of interest for documentation here.

Examples for savegames are given in /playground/gamedata/savegame-examples.
