<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">--------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Josef Spillner
&lt;dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net&gt;, May 2001</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">--------------------------------------------------------</P>
Please note that this is only an
alpha-version, released due to some</P>
discussion on kde-games-devel. The
&quot;real&quot; one with coding examples and</P>
library documentation, in HTML format,
will come around June 8, 2001.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">--------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>- Introduction -</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
Right now we have 13 game types
available for GGZ; some of them come with</P>
different frontends, that makes a total
of around 20 games. The game clients</P>
are compatible to each other if they
use the same server, which is currently</P>
the case for all of them. There could,
however, be different implementations</P>
even on the server side - for example,
two different card games which deal with</P>
the same game type like Spades or Skat.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
The first game I wrote was
Hastings1066, just to get into the feeling on how to</P>
write a GGZ game. At this time (...the
good old times :)) everything was coded</P>
byte by byte, there were only plans for
game module support via libraries.</P>
Soon after I realized that the whole
project would benefit from not only having</P>
Gtk+ games but also KDE ones. This is
how it all started (must have been around</P>
October 2000 or so).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>- The KDE games within GGZ -</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
Apart from KGGZ (the Core Client used
to launch games) my other primary task</P>
was to port at least some games to KDE,
or invent new ones. Ismael Orenstein,</P>
author of GGZ-KReversi, was faster than
me and placed his game in CVS first.</P>
He has used KDE Studio to achieve a
port of the user interface, and a C++</P>
protocol class (reversiprotocol.cpp)
which uses a list of opcodes and data for</P>
communication with the server. The data
exchange itself is typically handled with</P>
a QSocketNotifier, which is currently
used in all of our KDE games.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
Both KTicTacTux and KDots use a similar
technique, albeit there are some</P>
differences in their proto objects.</P>
Finally, there is Krosswater (ported
from the Java game Crosswater), which uses</P>
the MindX Zone library, which exists as
ZoneServer and ZoneClient classes.</P>
Unfortunately this isn't ready yet, but
it will be for 0.0.5. (Right now there</P>
is a lot of C code used in C++ wrapper
classes.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
This gives a total amount of 4 KDE
games, and that's a good start for this</P>
release. In order to keep balance
between the widget sets there is still need</P>
for more KDE games. To avoid
unnecessary duplicate work, the best choice are</P>
always new game types.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>- How to start -</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
A GGZ KDE game is basically a normal
KApplication which should have a menu bar</P>
and a status bar - displaying the
status is essential in turn-based games to</P>
avoid unnecessary server error messages
if it's not the player's turn, for</P>
example.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
The main view consists of the game
board (in case it's a board game), or</P>
whatever is appropriate for this type
of game. Ideally it provides some Qt</P>
signals which are emitted whenever the
player does an action, and some slots in</P>
case there is network input from other
players or the server-side AI. If the</P>
game is intended to run both
stand-alone and as a GGZ game module (for which a</P>
standard command line option named
--ggz exists), it is possible to have</P>
client-side AI as well. This has for
example been implemented in KTicTacTux,</P>
and as it shows up some more issues
I'll give a further explanation later in</P>
this document.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
The KApplication needs to be fed with
command line arguments (use KCmdLine for</P>
that purpose). That is:</P>
	-ggz (optionally; used to indicate a
difference between direct and core</P>
client launch)</P>
	-o (historycally; some old games need
this and the KApplication would</P>
refuse to start otherwise if it
receives this flag from the GGZ Core Client)</P>
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>- Connecting to the server -</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
On startup, the connection must be
established. The method doing this isn't</P>
that long, so I can include it here
directly:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">void CLASSNAME::connect()</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">{</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    char fd_name[64];</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    struct sockaddr_un addr;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    sprintf(fd_name,
&quot;/tmp/GAMETYPENAME.%d&quot;, getpid());</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    if((fd = socket(PF_LOCAL,
SOCK_STREAM, 0)) &lt; 0) exit(-1);</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    bzero(&amp;addr, sizeof(addr));</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    addr.sun_family = AF_LOCAL;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    strcpy(addr.sun_path, fd_name);</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">    if(::connect(fd, (struct sockaddr
*)&amp;addr, sizeof(addr)) &lt; 0) exit(-1);</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">}</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
Instead of quitting on connection
failure you can of course provide a fallback</P>
or just pop up a
KMessageBox::information saying that there is something wrong,</P>
e.g. the tmp/ directory is
write-protected or another weird thing which might</P>
have happened.</P>
Please note that the given socket name
must match the game type specified in</P>
the game module description file (more
on that later).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
If the connection is established, the
server will send you your seat number and</P>
the seat assignments. For example, if
you decided to play a Monopoly game (which</P>
has a maximum of 8 players) with 4
players only, where 2 of them are AI's and</P>
the third one is open for another real
player to join, you'll get the following</P>
results:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(int) seat number = 0</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(int) seat 0 assignment = PLAYER</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(char) player 0 name = Hans</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(int) seat 1 assignment = BOT</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(char) player 1 name = bot</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(int) seat 2 assignment = BOT</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(char) player 2 name = bot</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(int) seat 3 assignment = OPEN</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
Bots are typically named &quot;bot&quot;,
and open seats don't contain any name. The</P>
function reading this information must
be called whenever there are seat</P>
updates (players joining and leaving),
so make sure you don't mess up anything.</P>
As an example, if in the above case the
player Rudi joins the open seat, Hans</P>
gets the information updated:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(int) seat 3 assignment = PLAYER</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	(char) player 3 name = Rudi</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
And Rudi gets the same one too, except
his seat number is 3.</P>
The game client is responsible to
indicate that the game starts. This can be</P>
done by checking the number of open
seats. If none are open, it's the turn of</P>
the player (or bot) at seat 0,
displayed (if player) on the status bar with a</P>
message like &quot;Game started, please
do your move&quot;, whereas all other player</P>
should read something like &quot;Waiting
for opponent&quot;.</P>
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>- Game play -</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
In the shown case of turn-based games,
whenever the active player is ready with</P>
his move, the result must be sent to
the server. The GGZ standard way of doing</P>
so is using the easysocket library for
writing/reading the socket, but it can</P>
be done with the Qt library functions
as well. However, when using easysock,</P>
you're not on the wrong side, as issues
like IPv6, UDP and optimized support</P>
for real time games are already in
progress, mostly available as patches.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
If the move is accepted by the server,
it sends out the results to all players,</P>
and requests the next move from the
player who's turn is next. If the game is</P>
over, the results are broadcasted as
well, typically this message does only</P>
contain the winner's seat number to
save band-width.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
That's it. Easy, isn't it? The whole
behaviour can be fine-tuned by changing</P>
the implementation of the game servers
(which are always launched by the GGZ</P>
Gaming Zone server, ggzd).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>- Hints, options, pitfalls -</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
I have left open the discussion on two
topics until now:</P>
First: If any game is also playable
without GGZ, it might have to show a</P>
different behaviour depending on how it
is launched. If a game is designed to</P>
quit after the server says so, it
shouldn't quit in single-player mode, but</P>
instead show a dialog box asking for
another game or something. This should in</P>
this case of course be avoided when
playing over GGZ as the dialog box would</P>
disappear with the game itself on exit,
and this gives an ugly visual effect.</P>
<BR>
</P>
Second: Every game module must provide
accurate information about itself during</P>
the installation process. This is done
by providing a module.dsc.in file, which</P>
is then transformed into a module.dsc
file by autoconf, and installed by</P>
ggz-config. There is a special file
(named acinclude.ggz) for that purpose</P>
available within the GGZ kde-games
module. Please look at the existing games on</P>
how to include standard command line
options.</P>
