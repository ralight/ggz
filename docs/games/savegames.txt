Savegame formats used by GGZ games
==================================

GGZ games can write their game progress to a logfile. Once the game is
finished, the file is closed and stored as a permanent savegame. Therefore,
savegame formats which follow the gameplay, instead of just dumping the
current state of the game, are to be preferred, even though this isn't always
possible, especially for larger games.

Have a look at ggz-community/doc/Savegames to see which formats are supported
in the GGZ Community web application for review of played games through the
browser.
In addition, some of the game clients can also replay savegames. Such games
are marked below.

The GGZ board games have very common line-based savegames. Other games
might use standard formats. Have a look at
	http://dev.ggzgamingzone.local/protocols/
to see which savegame formats and protocols are being considered to be adopted
from standardised or otherwise omnipresent cases.

In the following list, for each game type (engine) there will be an entry on
which savegame format the server uses, if it is documented somewhere, if the
game server can also load the format again for game continuations, if the
savegame files can be reviewed in ggz-community and if there are game clients
which can replay the savegame files, possibly when running standalone.
