<p>
This document introduces the design of the GGZ server (ggzd) and explains
how it works. Additional reading is suggested in the GGZ Gaming Zone
Database document and the GGZ Hosting Guide.
</p>

<h3>Server structure and properties</h3>

<p>
The GGZ Gaming Zone server, named ggzd, is a Unix daemon written in C.
It handles connections from (GGZ) clients in multiple threads, and
launches games as external processes, with whom it also keeps a connection.
Data received from either the clients or the game servers is passed to
the other connection and/or stored in its database.
</p>

<p>
It consists of multiple subsystems and links statically to two libraries
which are also used by other programmes: the database abstraction library,
used by <tt>ggzduedit</tt> to manually manipulate player entries, and the
game server communication library <tt>ggzdmod</tt>, used also by the games
themselves. Further dependencies are <tt>libggz</tt>, <tt>expat</tt> for
the XML protocol handling, and <tt>gettext</tt> to display translated messages.
Optionally, <tt>howl</tt> can be included to announce its service on a local
network, where it can be detected by a GGZ core client (Zeroconf broadcast).
</p>

<p>
The database can either be embedded or running as an external process, even
on another host. Supported databases include <tt>DB4</tt>, <tt>SQlite</tt>,
<tt>MySQL</tt> and <tt>PostgreSQL</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The connections to the clients and to the game servers are always using
TCP/IP, although the latter ones are restricted to local connections.
</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>
When ggzd starts up, it will read command line arguments first, and configuration
files second. Depending on the configuration, a message of the day file (MOTD)
as well as the game rooms and game type description files will be read in.
It will then open the log files, and fork itself into the background.
There are still some smaller tasks to do before the service can be activated:
It announces the service to the LAN (optional), initializes its TLS library
wrapper (optional), and binds to the configured port.
From then on, clients are able to connect.
</p>

<p>
The server will run in the foreground if the <i>--foreground</i> option has
been given to it, which is very useful for debugging.
Logging can happen to a configured log file, and (in addition) some log types
can be given on the command line to appear on stdout, like
<i>ggzd -F --log=all</i>. The types are all documented in the configuration
file.
The server compile-time configuration can be shown with <i>--specs</i>.
Additional settings are internal to the source code and include the hard
limits on the maximum number of game types, the maximum length of user names
and the like.
</p>

<h3>Work model</h3>

<p>
During the connection period of a client, there are a number of events which
can occur. The first one is to handle the login procedure, which might require
player authentication or registration. The second is to handle player room
changes and chat messages. The third is to handle games, which means launching
a game server, putting the player (and all those who join) at the table,
and receive the game result afterwards, which might involve storing them
into the database.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the database, which is under complete control of ggzd,
each game is assigned a private data directory which can be used to save game
information. This includes savegames, to which only the path is stored in the
ggzd database.
</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>
The GGZ server is aware of the concept of privileges. Depending on the status
of a player (anonymous, registered or administrator), actions might or might
not be possible. In general, only administrators may broadcast messages to all
rooms and enter restricted rooms, and only registered users (including admins)
may get entries in the statistics database, although anonymous users are
registered there in the participation list.
