<h2>GGZ Gaming Zone Server Documentation</h2>

<p>
This document introduces the design of the GGZ server (ggzd) and explains
how it works. Additional reading is suggested in the GGZ Gaming Zone
Database document and the GGZ Hosting Guide.
The GGZ Protocol Specification also contains server-related information.
</p>

<h3>Server structure and properties</h3>

<p>
The GGZ Gaming Zone server, named ggzd, is a Unix daemon written in C.
It handles connections from (GGZ) clients in multiple threads, and
launches games as external processes, with whom it also keeps a connection.
Data received from either the clients or the game servers is passed to
the respective other connection and/or stored in its database.
</p>

<p>
It consists of multiple subsystems and links to several static and dynamic
libraries. It is important to know that many of these libraries are optional,
and they enable ggzd to offer more features, if the corresponding settings
have been activated in the main configuration file.
</p>

<p>
The static libraries reside with ggzd and are also used by other programs:
the database abstraction library <tt>libggzdb</tt>, which is used by
<tt>ggzduedit</tt> to manually manipulate player entries, the game server
communication library <tt>libggzdmod</tt>, used also by the games themselves,
and <tt>libggzmeta</tt> to publish information into the GGZ metaserver, also
used by tools such as <tt>telggz</tt> or <tt>metacle</tt> to query those
entries.
</p>

<p>
Further dependencies include <tt>libggz</tt>, <tt>expat</tt>, <tt>gettext</tt>
and optionally <tt>howl</tt> or <tt>avahi</tt>, plus (also optional)
<tt>fam</tt> or <tt>inotify</tt>. Additionally, depending on the database type,
a database client library will be needed, too.
The libggz library is mainly used for memory allocation, networking code and
security handling (both hashing and encryption).
The XML protocol handling is the task of expat, while gettext is used
to display translated messages.
Either howl or avahi can be included to announce the service on a local
network, where it can be detected by a GGZ core client, making use of Zeroconf
broadcasts. Either fam or the kernel-based inotify mechanism can be used to
detect changes to the room configuration, leading to the sending of updates
to the connected clients.
The two latter options and the database backend are collectively known as
'zeroconf', 'reconfiguration' and 'database' subsystems.
</p>

<p>
Further 'soft' dependencies include a portmap daemon and the fam daemon in
case of FAM being selected for reconfiguration, and a GGZ metaserver if
game information is published there in addition to zeroconf.
In case of using a SQL database backend, the matching SQL server must also
be running before ggzd starts.
</p>

<p>
The database can either be embedded or running as an external process, even
on another host. Supported databases include <tt>DB4</tt>, <tt>SQlite</tt>,
<tt>MySQL</tt> and <tt>PostgreSQL</tt>. With the <tt>DBI</tt> interface,
a number of databases can be used without recompilation of ggzd.
</p>

<p>
The connections to the clients and to the game servers are always using
TCP/IP, although the latter ones are restricted to local connections.
</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>
When ggzd starts up, it will read command line arguments first, and configuration
files second. Depending on the configuration, a message of the day file (MOTD)
as well as the game rooms and game type description files will be read in.
It will then open the log files, and fork itself into the background.
There are still some smaller tasks to do before the service can be activated:
It announces the service to the LAN (optional), initializes its TLS library
wrapper (optional), sets up a directory change watcher/monitor (optional)
and binds to the configured port.
From then on, clients are able to connect.
</p>

<p>
The server will run in the foreground if the <i>--foreground</i> option has
been given to it, which is very useful for debugging.
Logging can happen to a configured log file, and (in addition) some log types
can be given on the command line to appear on stdout, like
<i>ggzd -F --log=all</i>. The types are all documented in the configuration
file.
The server compile-time configuration can be shown with <i>--specs</i>.
Additional settings are internal to the source code and include the hard
limits on the maximum number of game types, the maximum length of user names
and the like.
</p>

<h3>Work model</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="ggzd.png" alt="GGZ server architecture">
</p>

<p>
During the connection period of a client, there are a number of events which
can occur. The first one is to handle the login procedure, which might require
player authentication or registration. The second is to handle player room
changes and chat messages. The third is to handle games, which means launching
a game server, putting the player (and all those who join) at the table,
and receive the game result afterwards, which might involve storing them
into the database.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the database, which is under complete control of ggzd,
each game is assigned a private data directory which can be used to save game
information. This includes savegames, to which only the path is stored in the
ggzd database.
</p>

<p>
The internal work model of ggzd is such that for each connection, a new thread
is created, called the player thread. Similarly, each launched table gets a
thread on its own (the table thread), while each game server runs as a
separate process. For each game server, there is exactly one table within
ggzd.
</p>

<h3>Games</h3>

<p>
The GGZ server launches games through the GGZ-side interface of the ggzdmod
library. Games use the game-side interface to this library in order to register
events and send requests.
</p>

<p>
Debug messages from game servers are sent to the GGZ server, where they are
processed according to the GGZ server's debugging policy. Likewise, statistics
reports at the end of a game end up in ggzd's database, whereas savegames are
stored within the directory for embedded databases on disk.
</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>
The GGZ server is aware of the concept of privileges. Depending on the status
of a player (anonymous, registered, host or administrator), actions might or might
not be possible. In general, only administrators may broadcast messages to all
rooms and enter restricted rooms, and only registered users (including admins)
may get entries in the statistics database, although anonymous users are
registered there in the participation list.
</p>

<p>
The management of privileges can to some extent be handled directly over the
network by already privileged players, whereas for detailed settings,
the ggzduedit tool is necessary. Refer to the GGZ Hosting Guide for details
on ggzduedit and to the core clients documentation for details on how to
administrate from within a core client.
