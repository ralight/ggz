Savegames, statistics and game restoration
==========================================

This text tries to shed some light on the process of storing information
about games played on the GGZ server (called matches in GGZ terminology).

Not all games support savegames. Those that do start by writing a contiguous
savegame file into their dynamic data area (usually $ggzdstatedir/gamedata/
$gamename). The name of the file must be unique, and upon creation is reported
to GGZ through a MSG_SAVEGAME_REPORT. The GGZ server writes this information
into the 'savegames' table, which lists all currently running games (with
savegame support, naturally), together with the date of creation and the owner
(i.e. table host player).
All the seats are written into the 'savegameplayers' table.

Once the game is finished, independent of savegame support, the match result
gets recorded through MSG_GAME_REPORT to GGZ. The GGZ server writes an entry
into the 'matches' table, which includes the game type, date of termination,
the winner and, if present, the name of the savegame file. The entry from the
'savegames' table is deleted. Another table named 'matchplayers' contains
information on the individual participants of the match, namely the name and
the player type (registered, bot, guest).

Yet another table, 'stats', contains aggregates statistics for each player and
for each game type. It gets recalculated automatically after a match, although
previously was calculated at regular intervals by an external tool.

Game restoration is a new feature which kicks in if the server is restarted
after an abnormal termination such as software crash our power loss. It reads
the list of pending savegames for each room and launches tables for any of
them. The game server will know it's being restored instead of created so that
the old savegame can be reused, through a MSG_SAVEDGAMES message.
In order to function effectively, the game server will then read the saved
game and modify its internal state accordingly. Since the seats are reserved
for the original players, they can join and continue the game at the point
where it was interrupted.
