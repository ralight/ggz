<h2>GGZ Gaming Zone Metaserver Documentation</h2>

<p>
With the introduction of the Metacle service and the necessary modifications
of the GGZ metaserver and its protocol, this document replaces the
old <a href="original.html">metaserver specification</a>.
It does however only give an introduction, leaving the details to the
text files which come with the metaserver source code, and the new protocol
specification document.
</p>

<h3>Metaserver Overview</h3>

<p>
Metaservers have a long tradition in gaming infrastructures: They are public
databases of game servers running on other hosts, and provide a reliable
static point of information about the location of such dynamic game servers,
often including other meta information such as the game server's location,
connection speed and version number.
</p>

<p>
The GGZ Metaserver (<tt>ggzmetaserv</tt>) is a very generic species. It has
been designed to be flexible enough to hold entries of various games at the
same time, and offers both a simple query mode and an XML mode. Publication,
modification and removal of entries is possible, and the server supports
authorisation for added security and peer notification for redundant
operation.
</p>

<p>
Advanced features include incremental notifications about changes, to allow
for real-time updates of interested applications (publish-subscribe method),
and incremental querying based on a client-side provided time delta value.
</p>

<h3>Entries</h3>

<p>
Each entry is of a certain <tt>class</tt> and a subordinate <tt>subclass</tt>,
also referred to as <tt>type</tt> or <tt>category</tt>. The class will almost
always refer to the game server name, whereas the categories refer to the
type of information one can retrieve. Therefore, categories commonly have a
name such as <tt>connection</tt> to get connection information, or
<tt>meta</tt> to find out other meta servers for this entry class.
Categories could however also refer to resources only available under some
classes, such as <tt>clubs</tt> to retrieve a list of web pages of
online playing clubs attached to a game.
</p>

<p>
The way the server works is that an initial XML configuration file is loaded
on startup, and the entries can be modified at runtime. A cache file can be
given to store the modified configuration, so it will survive a server
restart.
</p>

<p>
The server configuration not only contains lists of entries, one for each
class, but also a global configuration section which lists user privileges and
peer nodes. This section cannot be modified via the metaserver protocol, and
it doesn't have to be present, but when it is, it allows to control the amount
of modifications performed on the lists of entries.
Normally, all operations are allowed, but as soon as a restriction appears
in this section, it applies to some or all operations on the given class.
</p>

<h3>Usage in GGZ</h3>

<p>
The GGZ server, <tt>ggzd</tt>, is able to publish both itself and all games
which run on it to the metaserver. The first kind of publishing takes place
immediately on server startup, and it allows the GGZ core clients to get
information about where to find a GGZ server on the net.
The class <tt>ggz</tt> and the category <tt>connection</tt> are used in
such a scenario, whereas the category <tt>meta</tt> will contain all
other known GGZ metaservers.
</p>

<p>
The second kind helps game authors to spread information about their games
without having to run a metaserver on their own. GGZ publishes information
about all game rooms, independent of running games, to a category named
<tt>gameroom</tt> for each of the game classes. In addition, a
<tt>connection</tt> category will dynamically contain all the running games.
This information is the one which is used by the <tt>Metacle</tt> service
which aggregates information harvested from many metaservers, the GGZ
metaserver among them.
</p>

<h3>Protocol example</h3>

<p>
The following is a query and update example. For more information, have a
look at the dedicated GGZ Metaserver Protocol Specification.
</p>

<p>
Wildcard query to find out the classes currently stored in the metaserver:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;list /&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>
The result will arrive promptly:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;resultset referer="list"&gt;<br>
&lt;class&gt;ggz&lt;/class&gt;<br>
&lt;class&gt;tictactoe&lt;/class&gt;<br>
&lt;/resultset&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>
Query from the client to the server to return all GGZ servers which
understand protocol version 10:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;query class="ggz" type="connection"&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="protocol"&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;/query&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>
The answer which contains the only server that does:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;resultset referer="query"&gt;<br>
&lt;result uri="ggz://somehost:5689" mode="add"&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="preference"&gt;100&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="location"&gt;pennsylvania, us&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="speed"&gt;768&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="protocol"&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;/result&gt;<br>
&lt;/resultset&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>
Update request which then adds another server supporting this
protocol version:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;update class="ggz" type="connection" username="xxx" password="***"
mode="add" uri="ggz://anotherhost:5688"&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="version"&gt;0.0.14&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="protocol"&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="preference"&gt;50&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="location"&gt;lorraine/france&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;option name="speed"&gt;60 kB/s&lt;/option&gt;<br>
&lt;/update&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the update went smooth:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;resultset referer="update"&gt;<br>
&lt;status&gt;accepted&lt;/status&gt;<br>
&lt;/resultset&gt;<br>
</p>
