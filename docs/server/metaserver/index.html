This project has been founded to allow GGZ client programs to connect
dynamically to GGZ servers, without knowing their version numbers or host name.
Meta servers store lists of GGZ servers and pass them to the client on request.
Furthermore, they store lists of peer servers to distribute changes
automatically world-wide.

<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="pics/clients.png"><BR CLEAR="ALL">

GGZ Core Clients, such like KGGZ or GGZ-Gtk, can use the meta servers to
allow random connections, or to update their list of available hosts to connect
to. This ensures that servers with too old or too new versions of ggzd are
excluded automatically.
The GGZ Telnet Wrapper (TelGGZ) uses this functionality for a similar task.
<BR><BR>
There is only one mode the clients use (query connections), but there are two
different modes of doing this: Either they do a simple query using the URI
notation, or a more complex one using the XML protocol. For a detailed format
definition, see the specification below. The following could be an example of
such a query:
<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#445544">
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="4" FACE="arial,helvetica">
Query Client -&gt; Server:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffbb">
query://ggz/connection/0.0.5pre<BR>
</FONT>
Result Server -&gt; Client:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffbb">
ggz://ggz.snafu.de:5688<BR>
</FONT>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<BR>

In the issued query, 'ggz' is the class and 'connection' the subclass (named
'type') of the query, while '0.0.5pre' is the value. As one can see, other
classes can be used as well, which ensures the usage of the meta server is not
restricted to GGZ projects.
The result simply returns an URI which is understood by the GGZ core clients.
<BR><BR>

Using the XML format is not so easy but instead it provides a higher
flexibility. Let's repeat the example from above using XML notation:
<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#445544">
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="4" FACE="arial,helvetica">
Query Client -&gt; Server:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffbb">

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<BR>
&lt;query class="ggz" type="connection"&gt;<BR>
0.0.5pre<BR>
&lt;/query&gt;<BR>

</FONT>
Result Server -&gt; Client:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffbb">

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<BR>
&lt;resultset referer="query"&gt;<BR>
&lt;result preference="100"&gt;<BR>
&lt;uri&gt;ggz://jzaun.com:5688&lt;/uri&gt;<BR>
&lt;location&gt;pennsylvania, us&lt;/location&gt;<BR>
&lt;/result&gt;<BR>
&lt;/resultset&gt;<BR>

</FONT>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<BR>

It is now the client's task to build a list from this result set and either
choose one host from it (preferably the one with the highest priority), or let
the user select one.

The role of meta servers among each other is to distribte changes they received
from an administrator. The distribution follows several rules, and happens
automatically, while incorrect configuration of one server in such a web of
trust should leave most parts of the web intact.
<BR><BR>
Each meta server stores a list of peer servers which are to be notified when changes
occur, and each entry has the login data needed to authenticate on the peer
host. Logically each meta server does also store a list of logins, consisting
of username and password, of persons or servers which are allowed to issue
updates. The following illustration gives you an overview about the whole
update process. Note that updates can be additions, deletions and
modifications.

In the example above, the green boxes are players, and the ones with the black
point in them are administrators, who have direct access to the meta server
configuration.
The red disks are GGZ servers, and the blue disks represent meta servers, with
blue lines for the updates and dotted black lines for queries.
<BR><BR>

There exist currently two tools for administrators to update the meta servers:
A perl script named metaconf.pl, and a Qt GUI named QMetaGUI. Both fulfil the
task of avoiding typos and handling the XML embedding of the data.

The complete specification is available in text format. It does however only
describe the protocol, not the local configuration file format, so other meta
server implementations supporting the same protocol may be written.
A HTML page containing this specification is available
