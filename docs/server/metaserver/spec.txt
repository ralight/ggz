1. Scope of this document
-------------------------
The GGZ Gaming Zone Meta Server is a service to provide dynamic entries for
queries issued by client programs. Mostly the entries represent URIs to which
the client can connect, but the format does not restrict what kind of
information can be transmitted.
This specification describes the necessary protocol for the queries and the
automatic communication among the servers, and gives some hints for client and
server implementations in the last paragraph.

2. Client-Server URI Queries
----------------------------
A simple URI consists of a protocol, a host and a port part, in the form
PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT. GGZ clients use this data to connect to GGZ servers,
although they don't have to use an URI format, rather separate components which
would result in an URI like ggz://somehost.org:5688.
The URI query is used to get a single entry of this format. It expects a query
URI as input and outputs a connection URI then, or an empty string if either
the format, the class (protocol) or the subclass (type) is not supported:
	C -> S:
	query://CLASS/TYPE/ARGUMENT
In this case, 'ggz' might be the class, and 'connection' might be the type of
information the client wishes. The argument could be '0.0.5' which indicates
that only servers of version 0.0.5 should be included in the list of possible
results. The result, if not empty, is a simple URI:
	S -> C:
	PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT

3. Client-Server XML Queries
----------------------------
A XML query is issued by passing the same data to the server as in the URI
query, but in XML protocol format:
	C -> S:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<query class="CLASS" type="TYPE">
	ARGUMENT
	</query>
The server can, however, pass multiple results back, which are all embedded in
a result set:
	S -> C:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<resultset referer="query">
	<result preference="PREFERENCE">
	...
	</result>
	</resultset>
The preference ranges from 1 (low) to 100 (high) and is used by clients to do
their selection.
The contents of the result have no fixed format, although the following is used
within the GGZ class of queries and recommended for others:
	<uri>PROTOCOL://HOST:PORT</uri>
	<location>LOCATION</location>

4. Server-Server XML Communication
----------------------------------
In order to let different server implementations interact properly, their data
exchange must follow the specified format.
While this communication does mainly concern servers themselves, it is also
important for the administrators who want to initiate the changes on the first
server in the web.
There exist three forms of updates: additions, deletions and modifications. The
addition has the following format:
	S1 -> S2, or C -> S:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<update class="CLASS" type="CONNECTION" username="USERNAME" password="PASSWORD">
	<option name="NAME">ARGUMENT</option>
	...
	</update>
The number of options is not restricted.
A server responds with a status code which can be one of:
	accepted (The update was successful and will be broadcasted)
	rejected (The authentification has failed)
	wrong (Wrong format or missing attributes)
	error (An internal error occured)
The following is a complete server answer:
	S2 -> S1, or S -> C:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<resultset referer="update">
	<result>
	<status>STATUS</status>
	</result>
	</resultset>
Each server does then compare certain arguments and, if no one matches, adds
the entry to its list. If certain arguments match, the entry is updated. The
third form, deletions, can be present if the following option is used:
	<option name="mode">MODE</option>
Mode can be one of the following three:
	add (optional)
	modify (optional)
	delete (required)

5. Recommendations
------------------
a) Meta Servers should avoid loops when issuing updates. This can be resolved
in keeping a list of all broadcasted updates, and dropping an incoming update
if it is already in this list.

b) Clients which use the XML query format should either offer the result list
to the user so one entry can be selected, or select one entry on its own, or
support both ways. When selecting an entry, a high priority should increase the
chance of being selected, while those entries with a low priority should be
avoided as this may indicate slow connections (bandwidth) or filled-up or
special-purpose servers.

c) Meta Servers should log each and every conversation with both other servers
and with individuals.

d) Communication among meta servers should only be done with protection
mechanisms like Transport Layer Security. Queries, however, should not be
restricted as no sensible data is transmitted.

6. Examples
-----------
This is a list of possible communications using the 'ggz' class.

	S1 -> S2:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<update class="ggz" type="connection" username="joeuser" password="mypass">
		<option name="mode">delete</option>
		<option name="version">0.0.5pre</option>
		<option name="uri">ggz://somehost.net:5688</option>
	</update>

	S2 -> S1:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<resultset referer="update">
		<result>
			<status>rejected</status>
		</result>
	</resultset>

7. Status of this specification
-------------------------------
Everyone is welcome to modify this document and redistribute either the
original or the modified version. However, no such change is part of the
official GGZ Gaming Zone Meta Server Protocol unless the GGZ Development Team
has been contacted to incorporate changes into a new version of the protocol.
Modified versions should indicate clearly that they are modified, by whom and
which parts differ from the original specification.
