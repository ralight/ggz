* The "ggz design document" should be further trimmed to only document
  the main GGZ protocol. A new design document should be created. This will
  contain, among others, the information currently in the file
  ggzd/ggzd/meta/Uri-spec.txt, but also a lot more info GGZ standards
  and visions.
  The ggzd-specific parts of the current "ggz design document" should
  move into the ggzd documentation file (docs/server/ggzd).
