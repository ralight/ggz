* The "ggz design document" should be further trimmed to only document
  the main GGZ protocol. A new design document should be created. This will
  contain, among others, the information currently in the file
  ggzd/ggzd/meta/Uri-spec.txt, but also a lot more info GGZ standards
  and visions.
  The ggzd-specific parts of the current "ggz design document" should
  move into the ggzd documentation file (docs/server/ggzd).

* The unmaintained documentation should move into a "historic documents"
  section.
  This is a bit similar to the graveyard for code. However old documents
  often still contain wise information...
  Candidates are the "adding GGZ to games" text file, the articles,
  the old metaserver documentation, the historic ggz-kde-games text
  and more.
  Another area of cleanups are the internal GGZ games. The protocol
  documentation should move to ggzcomm. Everything else should be
  brought up to date.

* Currently, no inter-documentation links are possible. This is because
  the layout is different when installed from when being on the internet.
  Some unification must be done. However, the grouping is sometimes by
  content (e.g. server vs. games) and sometimes by form (e.g. guide
  vs. tutorial).
  Also, not everything on the internet is installed here, like doxygen
  API docs. They could be included as a copy maybe.
