Installation of the GGZ documentation
=====================================

There are currently only simply files in it, so all you have to do is running
./configure (./autogen from CVS), and 'make install'.
There will be a reason for calling 'make' soon, by docbook and kdoc and doxygen
files.

All files are normally installed under /usr/share/doc/ggz-doc/.
