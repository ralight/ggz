    <para>
      The main GGZ protocol is the protocol which is spoken and understood
      by the GGZ server <application>ggzd</application> and core clients
      which are connected to it. It handles player authentication, chat
      and game handling.
      This protocol is called the GGZ Protocol, and is available
      in a reference implementation named <application>libggzcore</application>,
      for core client authors, written in the C programming language,
      and its wrappers for C++ and Python.

    <title>The Protocol</title>

<para>
  The main protocol has a long history, it started out very simple and then
  was extended to add more and more gaming options. From version 5 on,
  the previous binary-opcode protocol was replaced by an extensible XML
  representation, which is processed with SAX parsers on both the client
  and the server side.
  Details of the protocol follow in the next chapter.
