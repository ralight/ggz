      This chapter is horribly out of date.  We will be fixing it soon
    </para>

  There are four parts which comprise the server side:

  The GGZ server will handle incoming connections, manage the user
  database, and keep track of all of the games being played
  (referred to as game tables). Clients are always in direct
  communication with control.
</para>

<para>
  Note that ggzd will not handle the specifics of how to play any
  particular game. That logic is contained in the individual game
  servers. It is expected (and hoped!) that game developers will
  write their own games servers for use with GGZ. GGZ will
  attempt to provide a simple framework for writing network games
  in which developers need not worry about connections or user
  logins or maintaining statistics. All of that will be done by
  GGZ. Game developers should only have to concern themselves with
  gameplay.
</para>

<para>
  The third item is more loosely connected. We will provide some
  sort of run-time configuration utilities for GGZ, so the main
  server will not have to be restarted (or worse.. recompiled!) in
  order for various options to be changed.
  The first such utility is ggzduedit, with which the user database
  can be edited.
</para>

</para>

<section id="control"><title>The GGZ server (ggzd)</title>
  <para>
    This is the main brain for the server side of GGZ. It handles
    client logins and new user registrations. It manages option
    negotiation with the clients, and launches new game sessions.
    It maintains a list of running game sessions and keeps a
    database of win/lose statistics for each user. It
    coordinates games, users, and databases, and is responsible for
    interacting with the client, the running games, and the config
    utility.
  </para>

  <para>
    Several possible designs were being considered before settling on the
    current one. It is possible that as GGZ develops this design
    will change as well. Since ggzd must communicate with
    multiple parties (game tables, users, etc.) it was decided to use a
    multi-threaded concurrent server where each connection (be it
    user or game table) gets its own thread. This avoids the
    situation where ggzd is servicing a request and therefore
    cannot handle any incoming connections or other requests. Brent
    chose threads rather than forking child processes because
    threads have a smaller overhead and it is easier to share memory
    between threads than between processes.
  </para>

  <para>
    Every time a new user connects, ggzd creates a new thread to
    handle all requests for that user. This thread is known as the
    player handler. If the user decides to launch a new game table,
    the player handler creates a thread to handle all requests from
    the game table. This new thread is known as the table handler.
    The table handler waits until enough players have joined the
    table and then forks a process, known as the game table process,
    in which to run the game server.
	(The reason game servers are not run within a thread is so that
	game developers not be required to worry about writing
	thread-safe code.)
  </para>

  <para>
    During the course of the game, the player thread for each player
    acts as a liaison between the player and the game table, passing
    requests back and forth transparent to the player and the game
    server. When a player logs out, the player handler thread is
    destroyed.
  </para>

  <section id="controlgame">
    <title>Interactions between ggzd and running games</title>
    <para>
      Quite a few game servers will be provided with GGZ, but it
      is hoped that others will write game modules, and either
      submit them for inclusion in the GGZ package, or
      maintain and distribute them separately. The following API
      describes how ggzd will interact with the game processes.
    </para>

	<note>
	  <para>
	    All interaction is enclosed within the ggzdmod library.
	    Game developers should use it (or any of its wrappers) so they don't
	    have to deal with the protocol in use directly.
	  </para>
	</note>

    <para>
      Four types of data are exchanged between ggzd and game servers:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>chr: a 1-byte signed char</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>int: a 4-byte signed integer in network byte order</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    str: a multibyte null-terminated string preceded by
	    its length (including null-termination) as an integer.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    fd: a file descriptor passed via sendmsg() along with a
	    single byte of dummy data
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      The following is a complete list of messages between the
      game module and the control section of the server. Again, I
      have chosen to intersperse game module requests with the
      corresponding control responses.
    </para>

    <para>
      Please note: the following is not written stone, merely a
      list of ideas.

      <programlisting role="pseudocode">

  <section id="controlconfig">
    <title>Interactions between ggzd and config utilities</title>
    <para>
      Since the server runs non-interactively in the background,
      there needs to be some run-time configuration tools so that
      server options may be changed without restarting.
	  Updates are either executed indirectly (e.g. when removing a
	  player from the database), or explicitely (e.g. when changing
	  some configuration parameters and sending a hangup signal
	  to ggzd).
	  The latter one will be steered by a configuration utility as well
	  at some point.
    </para>

<section id="gameservers"><title>Individual Game Servers</title>
  <para>
    As described above, game servers run in their own processes,
    and are responsible for handling the gameplay of a particular
    game.
  </para>

  <para>
    There are three possibilities for game server design.
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Compiled in. The game table process calls a startup
	  function which begins execution of the game server.
	  This scheme has the benefit that the server has access
	  to ggzd's data structures at the time the process was
	  forked. Communication between the game table and
	  ggzd can be via pipes or a socketpair. The problem
	  with this scheme is that to change which games are
	  offered by a particular server requires a recompile.
	  Not good.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Dynamically loaded modules. Similar to the above except
	  that game server exist as loadable modules which may be
	  inserted and removed at runtime. This allows for adding
	  new game types without a recompile. Downside is that it
	  requires both game developers and myself to know how to
	  deal with loadable modules.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Exec() separate program. In this scheme, GGZ acts
	  much like the inet daemon by handling the connections
	  and then doing a fork()/exec() to launch the game
	  server. This scheme also allows for adding new games at
	  runtime and has the bonus effect that game servers can
	  be written in other languages that C.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    The current design requires game servers of type three. It is
    possible however, that in the future GGZ will allow
    dynamically loaded server modules as well.
  </para>

  <para>
    Once the game server is running it is necessary that ggzd
    pass it some required information such as player names and
    file descriptors. This communication occurs over a pipe or
    socketpair which is established prior to the forking of the
    process. The interactions between game modules and the
    control section are listed above in section 3.1.1.1.
  </para>
</section>

<section id="configutility">
  <title>Config Utility</title>
  <para>
    There is currently one such tool, namely ggzduedit.
	It can be used to access the player database, edit permissions
	and add and remove registered players.
  </para>
</section>

<section id="subsystems"><title>Key Subsystems</title>
  <para>
    While the architecture of the server is divided into the aforementioned
    four parts, there are a few "subsystems" which are necessary.
  </para>

  <section id="optionparse"><title>Options Parser</title>
    <para>
      This is a two part system. One to parse the command-line
      arguments, and one to parse the configuration file. Options
      specified on the command line should have a higher
      precedence than those in the config file. Additionally, an
      alternate config file may be specified on the command line.
    </para>

    <para>
      At the present, the popt library is used for command-line
      parsing.
    </para>

    <para>
      The configuration file parsing is a three-phase process which
      bootstraps itself from a dark, dreary and empty server to one
      supporting multiple chat rooms, each of which can host one specific
      game:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Phase One: Read the ggzd.conf file from SYSCONFDIR.
	    The file to read can be determined at runtime with
	    the <emphasis>--file=/path/to/conffile</emphasis>
	    option. This feature is most notably used when testing a
	    new configuration.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The same line parser is used throughout the configuration
	    process. It is relatively simplistic, much like strtok(),
	    but processes an entire line in a single shot. It then
	    sets two module variables 'varname' and 'varvalue' to the
	    appropriate contexts from the configuration line. The file
	    parsers can then use these strings to configure various
	    run-time variables.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Phase Two: Scan all the game description files and parse
	    those which have been signaled as in use by the main
	    configuration file.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Phase Three: Scan all the room description files and parse
	    those which have been signaled as in use by the main
	    configuration file. These must be processed after the
	    game files, as each room will host a game which is already
	    loaded by phase two.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      The actual contents of the configuration files is discussed in
      the server administration documentation.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="userdb"><title>Login/User Database</title>
    <para>
      The server will need to store a database of user ID, name,
      password and permission at the very least.  This system must allow
      searching by name or ID, and allow for easy
      addition/deletion. GGZ can use libdb for
      this. A SQL database is possible too but probably not
      necessary for most installation.
	  Both PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported at this point.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="motd"><title>MOTD System</title>
    <para>
      The message of the day is read at initialization time from a file
      pointed to by the MOTD configuration file option. The file can
      consist of up to 80 lines (this is configurable at build via
      MAX_MOTD_LINES).
    </para>

    <para>
      The message of the day file can contain % specifiers which are
      replaced by the server before sending to the client. The following
      codes are supported:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    %a - Server administrator's name

    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="stats"><title>Player Statistics</title>
    <para>
      Since the game modules are dynamic, it makes sense to store
      the statistics on a per-game type basis, rather than on a
      per-user basis.
	  Statistics are currently handled by ggzdmod, independent from
	  ggzd. Several types will be supported eventually, some of
	  them are already implemented, e.g. win/loss or ELO.
