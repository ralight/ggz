    <title>Introduction by Brent M. Hendricks</title>
    <para>
      At some point during the development of
      <application moreinfo="refentry">NetSpades</application>, I
      realized that a major rewrite was in order.  I wasn't happy with
      the client/server interactions, and I wanted to add some
      features which just wouldn't work within the current
      infrastructure.  So I began to formulate grandiose plans for
      <application>NetSpades v5</application>, but continued to work
      on the 4.X series.  A little later, I began to contemplate
      adding the ability to play Hearts as well as Spades.  But why
      stop there?  Why not develop a general framework for playing
      networked games?  And so my plans have developed into what I
      called <application>NetGames</application>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Just before I was going to announce my new project on
      <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</ulink>, I
      happened across Rich's announcement and plans for an online
      gaming system.  It was to be in the same vein as Microsoft's
      Internet Gaming Zone, so he named it the <application>Gnu Gaming
      Zone</application>(<abbrev>GGZ</abbrev>).  His goals and plans
      were so similar to mine that I suggested we merge projects and
      collaborate.  He readily agreed, and the GGZ was born.
