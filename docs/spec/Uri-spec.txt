GGZ URIs
--------

Format:
ggz://user@host:port/#room/table

Everything beside the host is optional.
If a table is given, the action is to join the game on it.
If no table is given, but a room, a move into this room should occur.
If neither is given, a simple connection (to the lobby) takes place.

Protocol (ggz):
- describes an URI to a GGZ server or a room or table therein

User:
- username to use for login, used by core clients and maybe Community

Host:
- hostname of the server ggzd runs on

Port:
- ggzd port number, or 5688 by default

Room:
- room name or number as per ggzcore numbering (name is better)
- FIXME: room numbers shouldn't really be used anymore

Table:
- table id in the specific room

Examples include:
ggz://live.ggzgamingzone.org/#Tic-Tac-Toe (join TTT room)
ggz://you@live.ggzgamingzone.org/#Chess/0 (participate in Chess game)

Of course, table ids can be very short-living, except for keepalive games.
Room names should be valid for quite a while, while room numbers are less
stable due to possible server reconfigurations.

Addressing scheme of players (experimental)
----------------------------

Format:
ggz:user@host

This scheme is needed to initiate the contact to users from non-GGZ
systems, e.g. through WS APIs or from IM systems.
It's not used anywhere yet but reserving this addressing scheme
sounds like a good idea nonetheless.
