GGZ URIs
--------

The GGZ Gaming Zone service defines a URI format for locating
servers, game rooms and games.

The GGZ URI format is intended to conform to RFC 3987 [IRI] and
RFC 3986 [URI]. It follows the design consideration given in the
advisory document RFC 4395 alias BCP 115 and is intended to be
submitted for standardisation according to the procedures in the
same document.

Format:
ggz://[user@]host[:port][/#room[/table]]

## FIXME: define character set and normalisation rules (e.g. case
## sensitivity) for each URL component.

Everything beside the host is optional.
If a table is given, the action is to join the game on it.
If no table is given, but a room, a move into this room should occur.
If neither is given, a simple connection (to the lobby) takes place.

Protocol (ggz):
- describes an URI to a GGZ server or a room or table therein

User:
- username to use for login, used by core clients and maybe Community

Host:
- hostname of the server ggzd runs on

Port:
- ggzd port number, or 5688 by default {registered with IANA as 'ggz'}

Room:
- room name or number as per ggzcore numbering (name is better)
- FIXME: room numbers shouldn't really be used anymore
- FIXME: do we really want the "#" in here? It's not used for IRC URLs either

Table:
- table id in the specific room
- FIXME: this could use "#" to designate a fragment
  (advantage: we keep the door to hierarchical rooms open)

Examples include:
ggz://live.ggzgamingzone.org/#Tic-Tac-Toe (join TTT room)
ggz://you@live.ggzgamingzone.org/#Chess/0 (participate in Chess game)

Of course, table ids can be very short-living, except for keepalive games.
Room names should be valid for quite a while, while room numbers are less
stable due to possible server reconfigurations.

Addressing scheme of players (experimental)
----------------------------

Format:
ggz:user@host

This scheme is needed to initiate the contact to users from non-GGZ
systems, e.g. through WS APIs or from IM systems.
It's not used anywhere yet but reserving this addressing scheme
sounds like a good idea nonetheless.
