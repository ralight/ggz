* removal/change of kio_ggzmeta, use Metacle/Metakel instead
* removal of kio_ggz? it clashes with ggz:// protocol handler
* support of Friedrich's Kicker contacts applet
* for KDE 4, rewrite a lot!
* move Kopete support here, from playground (needs public headers or copy)
* moving ggzd launcher into a panel applet on its own (but with menu entry)
