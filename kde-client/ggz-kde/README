=============================================
KGGZ: The GGZ Gaming Zone Core Client for KDE
=============================================

KGGZ is one of the GGZ frontends. That means, it is intended to be used as a central
place for players to gather, chat and play games.
This is now version 0.0.4 of KGGZ. It is distributed under GNU GPL license conditions.

Requirements:
-------------
-gettext
-Xlib for the beep :)
-Qt 2.2.1+
-KDE 2.x (kdelibs should be sufficient)
	KHTML (optionally) for the browser
-the GGZ libs of course (easysock, ggz-client-libs)

Installation:
-------------
Just run ./autogen.sh. This should do everything for you.
During the installation process you will be prompted for your
root password.
For more detailed installation instructions, please have a look into README.GGZ
in the top-level directory.
After everything has installed, don't forget to run ldconfig as root because of
the included GGZCore++ library!

Directory structure:
--------------------
/ggzcore++/		- c++ wrapper for ggzcore
/data/			- images for kggz
/data/browser/	- local help files and links to the internet
/data/icons/	- internal icons
/data/kde/		- kde window manager icons
/po/			- translations
/src/			- source files
/src/widgets/	- network-independent qt widgets
/src/abstract/	- non-ui classes

What needs to be done?
----------------------
-documentation (html)
-port some of the games to kde (although one can use gtk+ games, of course)
-more more games for ggz!!!
-implement Zone stuff (this one is for me, hehe)
