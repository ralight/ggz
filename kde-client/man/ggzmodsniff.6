ggzmodsniff \- Sniffer for online game modules
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Modsniff, as ggzmodsniff is also called, contacts the GGZ game
module registry (usually /etc/ggz.modules), and compares it with
the games it has already created shortcuts for (usually under
$HOME/.kde/share/applnk/Games/ggz). If there are any updates,
it adds them. During the next months this tool will also be able
to detect external games and add them accordingly.
