Installation of GGZ-KDE
=======================

1. Make sure you have 2 packages installed:
	- easysock (for low level network functionality)
	- ggzcore (for frontend handling)
   You can find ggzcore in the ggz-client-libs package.

2. Make sure you have the correct versions of Qt
   and KDE installed. You need at least version 2.0
   of either one.

3. Type ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if not building from
   the CVS sources), make and make install (as root).
   Don't forget to run an ldconfig as well.

4. Have fun :)

5. A detailed GGZ installation help can be found in the project-wide used file
README.GGZ.
