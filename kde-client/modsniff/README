GGZ Module Sniffer
==================

This is an application which searches for GGZ games (which have preferably been
installed by ggz-config) and adds them to the window manager menus for
quick-start. Right now this does only work for KDE.

The module sniffer consists of a bunch of C functions (to be used in any
environment), and a ui-specific frontend (KDE in this case).
If you intend to write another frontend, just take this as an example, and look
at modsniff.h for all the easy funcions.
