The GGZ Gaming Zone - KDE Frontends and Clients - Version 0.0.10
================================================================

The KDE frontend applications for the GGZ Gaming Zone have been
extended a bit.
However, especially the new parts are not stable yet.

Content of GGZ-KDE:
	- GGZCore++, a high-level C++ API for handling online games,
		largely based on the ggzcore C library.
	- KGGZ, the well-known frontend. It provides a chat and is
		configurable.
	- GGZap, a GGZ quick launcher which can put itself into the taskbar.
	- KCMGGZ, a set of configuration dialogs for the KDE control center.
	- KIO_GGZ, a KIO slave to browse GGZ servers.
	- KIO_GGZMeta, another KIO slave which provides a general interface to meta
		servers of any kind (including the GGZ meta server).
	- ShadowBride, a graphical game protocol sniffing tool.
	- Keepalive Control, utility to administer Keepalive servers
	- Competition Calendar, a viewer for game schedules and results
	- KGrubby, a graphical configuration tool for grubby, the chatbot
