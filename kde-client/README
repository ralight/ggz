===============================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - KDE Frontends and Clients
===============================================

Beginning with version 0.0.4, GGZ is also available for our fellow KDE'ers.
Due to some lack of time there is currently only one application available,
but some more will follow soon.

Content of GGZ-KDE:
	- GGZCore++, a high-level C++ API for handling online games,
		largely based on the ggzcore C library
	- KGGZ, the well-known fronted. It provides a chat and is
		configurable.
Both have their own README for more information on them.

Please read 'INSTALL' if you aren't experienced with the build yet.

If you encounter any bugs, please send them to
	Josef Spillner, <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>,
or to the mailing list,
	ggz-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.

Have fun!
	- The GGZ Gaming Zone Development Team
