Installation instructions for GGZ Community
-------------------------------------------

A word of advice at the beginning: Installing GGZ Community is not just a
matter of running two commands and be done with it, a comfort that one
usually has with other GGZ packages.
Instead, Community integrates with both the GGZ server and with the
web server, and optionally with a lot of additional content.

This document describes the installation of the GGZ Community web portal.
The addition of the API functionality is covered by api/setup.txt.
A reference instance of the web portal is running live at
http://www.ggzcommunity.org. It is using the stock Community installation
together with content which is available from GGZ Playground. Every
instance will require its own modifications, although none are strictly
necessary.

A note for the impacient: There is also a shell script named setup.sh
available. It hasn't been tested thoroughly up until now, and will likely
only work on certain systems. If in doubt, follow this text and work
through everything step by step.

Install the web interface
-------------------------

Copy the 'web' directory into a dedicated directory accessible to your web
server. Some parts of Community might work without a dedicated virtual host,
but there are no guarantees.

In the web server configuration, create a virtual host entry for a site name
of your choice. For example, the following section will work with Apache
when pasted into /etc/apache2/sites-available/ggzcommunity:

<VirtualHost *>
	ServerName ggzcommunity
	DocumentRoot /path/to/web
	<Directory />
		AllowOverride All
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

The web server integration is assuming Apache 2.x. There is a template
for the sites-available directory in webserver/ggz-apache2.conf.in.
The script setup.sh, when used, will fill out the template.

Finally, point your browser to the host. You should see a GGZ Community
instance which will recognize by itself that it hasn't been configured yet.

Install external software
-------------------------

Depending on what additional software should be made available within
Community, the following pieces must be installed and configured
separately.

www/forums/phpBB2: phpBB2 (Forum software)
 from http://www.phpbb.com/
 chrome_ex patches from setup/forum

www/hotstuff/directory/: Hotstuff (GHNS backend software)
 from setup/hotstuff

www/blogs/config/: Planet configuration (RSS feed aggregator)
 from setup/blogs

www/db/ggzicons/flags/:
 directory '/usr/share/locale/l10n' from KDE

Create GGZ database
-------------------

In order to make Community work, it needs to know which SQL database the
GGZ server operates on. In the average case, telling Community the path
to ggzd's configuration file (ggzd.conf) will suffice already, although
different parameters can be configured manually in case no GGZ server
is running locally.
Before the configuration can start, a few SQL tables need to be created
which might or might not be present already on a vanilla GGZ server.

SQL setup
 from setup/sql

Configuration
-------------

All htconf-dist files must be copied to .htconf and be modified.
In particular, web/common/.htconf contains the main configuration.

The file 'custom.txt' further explains on how to customize a GGZ Community
installation.

Scripts
-------

A couple of scripts are available which should be run regularly (via cron)
or manually by hand. Their usage depends on how Community is configured.

* calcrankings
  - calculates the player rankings for those games that support it
* ggz2phpbb.pl
  - synchronizes phpBB user database from GGZ user database
* tracker.pl
  - lists in XML format the currently running games and logged in players
* ggzblogs.pl
  - creates the sections part of the planet configuration file (blogs)

Savegames
---------

db/matches/teg:
 should contain an unpacked TEG theme
