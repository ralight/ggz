Customized Community
--------------------

* The directory images/ can be copied to another name
  and then be referenced in .htconf as a new theme.
  This includes the stylesheet, images and the layout.

* Most configuration items in .htconf are translatable.
  Instead of
    $var = "value";
  one can write instead
    $var[''] = "value";
    $var['de'] = "value2";
  Note that in the latter case, no simple $var must occur anymore
  and an empty language ('') must always be provided as a fallback.

* Translations of variables in page templates are done in common/po.
  The script extract.pl gets all strings, either untagged like _(x)
  or tagged like _(x)(tag). They are then stored in ggzcommunity.pot
  and this file can be copied to lang.po and be translated and installed.
  It is important to implement Locale::localename() for new languages
  depending on the system, and also Locale::languagename() should be
  amended.

* Translations of PHP strings are done using a __(x) construct. These
  strings are extracted by extract-php.pl. They may contain PHP variables.

* Hacking:
  Each page must include top.inc and bottom.inc with include(), not with
  include_once()! All other files can/should be included with include_once().

  The classes
    Database (common/database.php)
    Config (common/config.php)
	Locale (common/locale.php)
  are the top-most classes which are used only internally.

  The classes
    Auth (common/auth.php)
  are on the second level.

  The files
    negotiation.php
	access.php
	navbar.php
  are used in addition on every request.

  The classes
    Country (common/countrylist.php)
    Gender (common/genderlist.php)
    Match (common/match.php)

  are used on certain pages and depend on the others above.
  In addition, the files
