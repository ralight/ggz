Customized Community
--------------------

* The directory images/ can be copied to another name
  and then be referenced in .htconf as a new theme.
  This includes the stylesheet, images and the layout.

* Most configuration items in .htconf are translatable.
  Instead of
    $var = "value";
  one can write instead
    $var[''] = "value";
    $var['de'] = "value2";
  Note that in the latter case, no simple $var must occur anymore
  and an empty language ('') must always be provided as a fallback.

* Translations of variables in page templates are done in common/po.
  The script extract.pl gets all strings, either untagged like _(x)
  or tagged like _(x)(tag). They are then stored in ggzcommunity.pot
  and this file can be copied to lang.po and be translated and installed.
  It is important to implement Locale::localename() for new languages
  depending on the system, and also Locale::languagename() should be
  amended.
