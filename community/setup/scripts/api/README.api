This is a client-side script to the GGZ Community Web Services API.
Its intended use is to list, add, edit and remove players, teams and
statistics.

In addition to the script, the following test procedures might help
for debugging (if $debug is turned on in API's .htconf):

echo "<xml/>" | \
  lwp-request -m PUT -c "application/ggzapi+xml" \
  -f http://api/api/path

curl -H "Content-type: application/ggzapi+xml" \
  -d "<xml/>" http://api.ggzcommunity/api/path
