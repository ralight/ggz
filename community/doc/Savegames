Savegame support in GGZ Community
=================================

Any match registered in the database with a corresponding savegame can be
viewed and at least partly verified by loading it into GGZ Community's
savegame viewer. Right now only the endgame position is displayed,
although a step-by-step replay through the game might be possible in
the future.

Each savegame handler consists of a 'Savegame' class to load the game
and a GD-based script to display the game board graphically, either
drawing with graphics primitives or using images or both.

Right now the following savegame handlers exist:

* Chess (PGN format)
* Connect the Dots (custom format by GGZ)
* Freelords (custom XML format)
* Go (SGF format)
* TEG (custom XML format)
* Tic-Tac-Toe (custom format by GGZ)
* Reversi (custom format by GGZ)
* ConnectX (custom format by GGZ)
