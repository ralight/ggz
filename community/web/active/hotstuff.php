	The
	<a href="http://www.kstuff.org/">Get Hot New Stuff</a>
	framework is a (not so) new way of
	enhancing games with additional content such as games, themes,
	background graphics and more.
	GGZ game level editors which support GHNS uploads are preconfigured
	already to use the GGZ Community repository.
	All users have FTP write access and can upload data which is later
	made available to all by the GGZ Community administrators.

	Have a look at the
	<a href="/hotstuff/">Hotstuff web interface</a>
	to see what has been uploaded already and is thus
	ready for download by gamers.
