Announcing the release of The GGZ Gaming Zone v0.0.10!

The GGZ Gaming Zone (GGZ) is an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players
(and grubby, the chat bot) as well as watching them play.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players
(quite a few game support statistics now).
A web interface allows for tournament, team and rankings tracking.

Features in this release:

- GGZBoard, a pygame-based board game framework, comes with 5 games already
- Embedded ggzcore, enabling games like Widelands to act as GGZ core clients
- Game content enhancements: Get Hot New Stuff integration and SVG support
- GGZ support for IM clients (Gaim, Kopete) as a plugin
- Advanced statistics and player community features through GGZ Community
- Zeroconf support for GGZ usage in LANs
- Enhanced Win32 compatibility for GGZ libraries
- and many more!

See README.GGZ for an overview, or QuickStart.GGZ to get started with the
GGZ client.
