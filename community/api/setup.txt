How to setup the Web Services API
---------------------------------

This documentation assumes the use of the Apache web server with PHP 4.2 or
later installed.

<VirtualHost *>
	ServerName api.ggzcommunity
	DocumentRoot /path/to/api
	AliasMatch ^/api/(.*)$ /path/to/api/api/index.php
</VirtualHost>

Hacker's note:
Access to the virtual host context of Apache is needed so we can pretend
virtual directories and files. The usual ErrorDocument hack only works with
GET, not with POST, as the internal redirect always becomes a GET.

Another hacker's note:
In setup/script/api, there is a client-side test script (ggzapi_client.pl)
which can be used to test the service.
