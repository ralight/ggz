=========
- Add new dialog for specifying number of seats at table, computer players,
and reservations.  Something with rows where each row represents a seat, and
then have radio buttons for: open, reserved, or computer.  This should be
part of the ggz client, not the game_client.  The game_client should only
worry about options for itself.

==========
- Implement a standalone or offline client.  This could actually be very
simple.  It would have to have access to both the game_server and
game_client programs.  Then it could create a socketpair() and fork
processes for those two, dup'ing as necessary so that the game_client and
game_server talk directly to each other without an intermediary.  The main
client would still have to relay options via stdin/stdout the way ggzd does
now.
