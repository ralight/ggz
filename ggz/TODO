medium run
==========
- Implement a standalone or offline client.  This could actually be very
simple.  It would have to have access to both the game_server and
game_client programs.  Then it could create a socketpair() and fork
processes for those two, dup'ing as necessary so that the game_client and
game_server talk directly to each other without an intermediary.  The main
client would still have to relay options via stdin/stdout the way ggzd does
now.

- compile time GNOME support option

long run
========
- banner add above status bar (compile time option - on, off)
