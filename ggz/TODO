* Done


For 0.0.2
=========

* Add new dialog for specifying number of seats at table, computer players,
and reservations.  Something with rows where each row represents a seat, and
then have radio buttons for: open, reserved, or computer.  This should be
part of the ggz client, not the game_client.  The game_client should only
worry about options for itself.

- IRC stile actions in the chat  ex.  /me says hello
* Connect button in menu and toolbar
* MOTD item under view menu
- config file code
- configurible font size in chat and MOTD
- config dialog
* make /beep not print to the terminal
* Connect menu on far left (Connect, Disconnect, Login, Logout, Exit)
- Help menu on far right (About)
* Game menu (Launch, Join, Leave)
- View menu (Game types, MOTD)
* double-click a game joins it
- chat autoscroll off
* Room support for chat

For 0.0.3
=========

- Save last server/port/username between sessions
- Server "Profiles" (last 5 servers/logins)
- crypt() passwords ??
- configurible colors (3-4 color themes, light, dark, laptop, wacked out, etc.)
- user-customizable toolbar
* Right-click pop-up for tables (join/launch, options, players)
- Right-click pop-up for players
- log chats to file

For 0.0.4
=========

- user buildable color themes.
- background images for chat, table, and player areas
- Icons for toolbar/menus

medium run
==========
- Implement a standalone or offline client.  This could actually be very
simple.  It would have to have access to both the game_server and
game_client programs.  Then it could create a socketpair() and fork
processes for those two, dup'ing as necessary so that the game_client and
game_server talk directly to each other without an intermediary.  The main
client would still have to relay options via stdin/stdout the way ggzd does
now.

- compile time GNOME support option

long run
========
- banner add above status bar (compile time option - on, off)
