/* Chess module design
 *
 * We should have 5 game states:
 * CHESS_STATE_INIT
 * CHESS_STATE_WAIT
 * CHESS_STATE_PLAYING
 * CHESS_STATE_DONE
 *
 * And we should have the following events
 * CHESS_EVENT_INIT
 * CHESS_EVENT_SEAT
 * CHESS_EVENT_PLAYERS
 * CHESS_EVENT_QUIT
 * CHESS_EVENT_MOVE_END
 * CHESS_EVENT_MOVE
 * CHESS_EVENT_TIME_REQUEST
 * CHESS_EVENT_TIME_OPTION
 * CHESS_EVENT_GAMEOVER
 * CHESS_EVENT_START
 * CHESS_EVENT_UPDATE_TIME
 * CHESS_EVENT_REQUEST_UPDATE
 * CHESS_EVENT_FLAG
 * CHESS_EVENT_DRAW
 *
 * The events and states work like this:
 *
 * CHESS_STATE_INIT
 * 
 *  Load the bitmaps, configure the pixmap buffers, connect to the game server.
 *  Issue an CHESS_EVENT_INIT and go to WAIT state
 *
 * CHESS_STATE_WAIT
 *
 *  Get the seat, players and time option. Wait until a EVENT_START
 *
 * CHESS_STATE_PLAYING
 *
 *  Play the game. Receive UPDATE_TIME, REQUEST_UPDATE, GAMOEVER, etc events.
 *
 * CHESS_STATE_DONE
 *
 *  The game is over, there is nothing left now.
 *
 * The events are hooked up this way:
 *
 * CHESS_EVENT_SEAT           -> When we receive a MSG_SEAT
 * CHESS_EVENT_PLAYERS        -> When we receive a MSG_PLAYERS
 * CHESS_EVENT_QUIT           -> When the user exits the game
 * CHESS_EVENT_MOVE_END       -> When the user finishes dragging a piece
 * CHESS_EVENT_MOVE           -> When the server sends us a move
 * CHESS_EVENT_TIME_REQUEST   -> When we receive a REQ_TIME (ie, the server is
 *                               asking our time option)
 * CHESS_EVENT_TIME_OPTION    -> When we receive a RSP_TIME (ie, we now know the
 *                               time option)
 * CHESS_EVENT_GAMEOVER       -> When we receive a MSG_GAMEOVER
 * CHESS_EVENT_START          -> When we receive a MSG_START
 * CHESS_EVENT_UPDATE_TIME    -> When we receive a RSP_UPDATE
 * CHESS_EVENT_REQUEST_UPDATE -> When the user requests a time update
 * CHESS_EVENT_FLAG           -> When the user calls a flag
 * CHESS_EVENT_DRAW           -> When the server asks if we want to draw the
 *                               game
