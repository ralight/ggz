#define PROTOCOL_VERSION 9

/* Combat Protocol Version 0.1
 *
 * g : ggz server (gserv)
 * s : combat server (cserv)
 * 1c: one player
 * nc: all human players
 *
 * ### g --> s	: REQ_GAME_LAUNCH ###
 *
 * Then the cserv inits the options to NULL (to safely check later
 * if they are set), and runs ggz_game_launch()
 *
 * ### g --> s  : REQ_GAME_JOIN ###
 *
 * The cserv does:
 *
 * ggz_player_join()
 * Sends to the joining player his seat, the number of players
 * and the protocol version
 * 		[ s --> 1c : CBT_MSG_SEAT (int)SEAT (int)PLAYERS (int)PROTOCOL_VERSION ]
 * Then he sends the player list to all the players
 * 		[ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_PLAYERS (PLAYER_LIST) ]
 * If the options are already set, he sends the options to the player
 * 		[ s --> 1c : CBT_MSG_OPTIONS (string)OPTIONS_STRING ]
 * It now depends on the current state:
 *  CBT_STATE_WAIT:
 *      If this is the first player to join the table, it requests the
 *      game options from him.
 * 		  [ s --> 1c : CBT_REQ_OPTIONS ]
 *      If there are no more open seats and the options are all set, 
 *      it starts the game (requests all the players to set up their units)
 * 		  [ s --> nc : CBT_REQ_SETUP ]
 *  CBT_STATE_SETUP:
 *      It tells the player that we are at SETUP state
 *      [ s --> 1c : CBT_REQ_SETUP ]
 *  CBT_STATE_PLAYING:
 *      It tells the player what are the units
 *  		[ s --> 1c : CBT_MSG_SYNC (int)TURN (str)SYNC_STR ]
 *  		Also tells the player that we are already playing
 *  		[ s --> 1c : CBT_MSG_START ]
 *  CBT_STATE_DONE:
 *      Tells the player what are the units
 *  		[ s --> 1c : CBT_MSG_SYNC (int)TURN (str)SYNC_STR ]
 *  		Also tells the player who won
 *    	[ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_GAMEOVER (int)WINNER ]
 *
 * ### g --> s : REQ_GAME_LEAVE ###
 *
 * ggz_player_leave
 * Sends the player list
 * 		[ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_PLAYERS (PLAYER_LIST) ]
 * The client should always stop the game if it's already playing and he
 * receives a player list
 * Now it depends on the current state
 * CBT_STATE_WAIT:
 *  If this player is the host, discard him as host.
 *  Make the next player as host
 *  If he isn't the host, then just wait until all the players join
 * CBT_STATE_SETUP:
 *  If this player has already setup his units, discard them.
 *  Else, just wait
 * CBT_STATE_PLAYING:
 *  Wait for another player
 *
 * ### s <-- 1c: CBT_MSG_OPTIONS (string)OPTIONS_STRING ###
 *
 * The options_string is written like this:
 * (++ is concatenation)
 *
 * map_width ++ map_height ++ map_data ++ army_data ++ game_options ++ \0
 *
 * To each value in the string is then added 1 (except to the closing \0), so
 * that the result looks like a string, and then sent using es_write_string
 *
 * map_data: The terrain data. Composed of width*height bytes like:
 * 
 * 	00000000
 * 	----
 * 	Owner data. It can be:
 * 		0000 -> No one. This land belongs to no player
 * 		0001
 * 		.... -> This land belongs to player (N-1)
 * 		1111
 * 	The player can only put its units, on the preparation time, on
 * 	a tile that belongs to him.

 * 	00000000
 * 	    ----
 * 	Terrain data. It can be:
 * 		0000 -> Open terrain
 * 		0001 -> Null terrain (for use in maps that aren't rectangles)
 * 		0010 -> Lake
 * 		0011
 * 		.... -> Other terrain types that may be created
 * 		1111
 * 		
 * 	army_data: The initial army for all the players. 12 bytes, in
 * 	this order:
 *
 * 	0 -> Number of flags
 * 	1 -> Number of bombs
 * 	2 -> Number of spys
 * 	3 -> Number of scouts
 * 	4 -> Number of miners
 * 	5 -> Number of sergeants
 * 	6 -> Number of lieutenant
 * 	7 -> Number of captain
 * 	8 -> Number of majors
 * 	9 -> Number of colonels
 * 	10 -> Number of generals
 * 	11 -> Number of marshalls
 *
 * 	game_options: To avoid problems between wrong versions of the protocol,
 * 	all the game options are enclosed in packets, like this:
 *
 * 	(byte)OPTION_IDENTIFER ++ OPTION_DATA ++ \0
 *
 * 	The client then receives each packet and reads the OPTION_IDENTIFIER. If it
 * 	is a know one, then it reads the OPTION_DATA and does what is appropriated.
 * 	If it isn't, then it should tell the user (probably with a msgbox), and try
 * 	to run the game (for some options it should be able to run without problem)
 *
 * OPTIONS_IDENTIFIERS:
 *
 *  01h -> Map Name
 *
 *    It's the name of this map, so that the client may know which is the
 *    default name when saving it. THe OPTION_DATA is a string (*including* a
 *    closing \0) with the name of the map
 *
 *  02h -> Binary Options Pack 1
 *
 *    It's a pack of 16 binary options. The OPTION_DATA are two bytes
 *    (16 bits). Each one of the 16 options have a id. The options that are on
 *    and whose id is <= 256 are ||ed in the first byte. Those options
 *    whose id is > 256 receive a 8 bits right shift and then are ||ed on the
 *    second byte. The options are (in order):
 *
 *      - OPT_OPEN_MAP                \
 *      - OPT_ONE_TIME_BOMB           |
 *      - OPT_TERRORIST_SPY           |\
 *      - OPT_MOVING_BOMB             | > first byte
 *      - OPT_SUPER_SCOUT             |/
 *      - OPT_MOVING_FLAG             |
 *      - OPT_RANDOM_OUTCOME          |
 *      - OPT_ALLOW_DIAGONAL          /
 *
 *      - OPT_UNKNOWN_VICTOR           \
 *      - OPT_SILENT_DEFENSE          |
 *      - OPT_SILENT_OFFENSE          |\
 *      - OPT_RANDOM_SETUP            | > second byte
 *      - OPT_SF_SERGEANT             |/
 *      - OPT_RUSH_ATTACK             |
 *      - OPT_HIDE_UNIT_LIST          |
 *      - OPT_SHOW_ENEMY_UNITS        /
 * 	 
 * The server then check for the validity of this options. Things to
 * check:
 * 	- The players have at least 1 flag?
 * 	- The players have at least 1 moving unit?
 * 	- The map has enough starting positions for all players?
 *
 * 	If they are valid, it sends them to all the players
 * 		[ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_OPTIONS (string)OPTIONS_STRING ]
 * 	If they aren't valid, it requests them again. The client should
 * 	tell the player why he is seeing the options dialog _again_
 * 		[ s --> 1c : CBT_REQ_OPTIONS ]
 *
 * 	// Until here up, I have thought a lot... from now on, I'm not 
 *  sure if this is the right direction //
 *
 * The client should allow the player to set his units up right from
 * the moment he received the game options, but can't allow him to
 * send them until he received a CBT_REQ_SETUP
 *
 * 1c --> s : CBT_MSG_SETUP (string)ARMY_SETUP 
 * Where ARMY_SETUP is a string of len N, where N is the number
 * of tiles belonging to this player. Each byte will be like this:
 *
 * 00000000
 * ----
 *    Owner code: Just like in the OPTIONS_STRING, although it
 *    can't be NULL!
 *
 * 00000000
 *     ----
 *    Unit code (the definitions are later on this header file)
 * If this player has more tiles than the number of starting positiions,
 * then he can have some with a unit code of EMPTY.
 *
 * The owner code isn't really necessary for the protocol, but it
 * makes easier to just copy the values to the server variables... :) 
 *
 * The server should check if the player isn't cheating here! If the
 * setup he sent is not valid, it sends another REQ_SETUP
 * 	[ s --> 1c : CBT_REQ_SETUP ]
 * A good client should also check for the validity of the setup before
 * sending it.
 *
 * When all the players have correctly set their units up, then the
 * server starts up.
 * 	[ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_START ]
 *
 * The game always starts with player number 0. The client should keep
 * track of the current turn, to not allow anyone to send a move out
 * of his turn (And the server can't accept those!)
 *
 * ### s --> nc : CBT_MSG_START ###
 * 
 * When the client receives a CBT_MSG_START, he then can do two things:
 * if its his turn, it waits until the player moves, and then send:
 * 	[ 1c --> s : CBT_REQ_MOVE (int)FROM (int)TO ]
 * either its his turn or not, it waits to receive from the server one
 * of:
 *  [ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_MOVE (int)FROM (int)TO ]
 *  [ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_ATTACK (int)FROM (int)WHO (int)TO (int)WHO ]
 *  Where the WHO can be negative, which means that they won the combat
 *  The OWNER code is _NOT_ enconded in the WHO
 *  And then it changes the game state and changes the current turn.
 *
 * The server, after sending a CBT_MSG_START, enters playing state,
 * and waits until a CBT_REQ_MOVE. Then he does:
 *
 * ### 1c --> s : CBT_REQ_MOVE (int)FROM (int)TO ###
 *
 * First thing to check: It is the turn of this player?
 * If it is, continue.
 *
 * Then check if this move valid. The following stuff is important:
 * 	- The FROM unit belongs to this player?
 * 	- The FROM unit is a moving one?
 *  - Is the TO tile OPEN?
 * 	- The move is up/down or left/right?
 * 		- X(FROM) == X(TO)     or
 * 	- Y(FROM) == Y(TO) 
 * 	(X and Y are macro included on this header)
 *  - If the FROM unit is not a scout, then
 *    - abs(X(FROM) - X(TO)) == 1    or
 *    - abs(Y(FROM) - Y(TO)) == 1
 *  - If it is a scout, it checks for all the tiles between the
 *  FROM and the TO, if all of them are OPEN and there isn't any
 *  enemy between them.
 *
 * If the TO tile is not a enemy, it sends:
 *  [ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_MOVE (int)FROM (int)TO ]
 *	(note that the unit code isn't reported!)
 * If the TO tile is a enemy, it sends:
 *  [ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_ATTACK (int)FROM (char)WHO (int)TO (char)WHO ]
 *  Where the WHO can be negative, which means that they won the combat
 *  The OWNER code is _NOT_ enconded in the WHO
 *  (note: Maybe it should send the ATTACK msg only to the players
 *  that are taking part on the attack, and send a MSG_MOVE to the
 *  others)
 *
 *  It then checks if the game is over. Must check:
 *  	- TODO: Must see what are the winning conditions on multiplayer
 *  	stratego
 *
 *  If it is over, it sends
 *  	[ s --> nc : CBT_MSG_GAMEOVER (int)WINNER ]
 *  	TODO: Must see what needs to be sent: The winners? The losers?
 *
 *  If the game is not over, it changes to the next turn and waits
 *  until a REQ_MOVE is sent.
 *
 *  MISCELLANEOUS:
 *
 *  The player can be out of sync with the server for some network
 *  error... or maybe he has just joined a running game. If the
 *  client wants to be in sync, he sends:
 *  	[ 1c --> s : CBT_REQ_SYNC ]
 *  And the server must answer with
 *  	[ s --> 1c : CBT_MSG_SYNC (str)SYNC_STR ]
 *  Where SYNC_STR is the current map data, composed of:
 *
 * (char)CURRENT_TURN +
 * (char)CURRENT_STATE +
 * (str)MAP_DATA:
 *
 * 	00000000
 * 	----
 * 		Owner data
 *
 * 	00000000
 * 	    ----
 * 	  Unit data. If its the unit of the requesting player, then it
 * 	  sends the correct data. Else, it sends 1111 (UNKNOWN)
 *
 * The client may have forgotten the options for some weird reason. If he
 * wants to get them again, he can just send:
 * [ 1c --> s : CBT_REQ_OPTIONS ]
 *
 * I guess this is all... at least for now...
 * TODO: Add PLAY_AGAIN feature
