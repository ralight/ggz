What *must* be done before next version of GGZ:

- Add a "Save" button to the map editor
- Add some counters to the map editor (how many of each type of terrain, how
  many units in the total)
- Make possible to return to a running game

What should be done before next version of GGZ:

- Add some map options
- Make the client check if the current map options are valid before sending
  them
- Make the name of the map be sent to the other player, so that he can have an
  idea of how to call this map

What should be done someday

- Tilesets
- 3 or 4 players support
- A webpage for the game
- Saving/Resuming
