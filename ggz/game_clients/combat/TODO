What *must* be done before next version of GGZ:

- Preview of map on the map editor
- Make possible to return to/join a running game

What should be done before next version of GGZ:

- Add some map options
- Improve the interface of the counters
- Make the client check if the current map options are valid before sending
  them
- Make the name of the map be sent to the other player, so that he can have an
  idea of how to call this map
- Add a "Yes/No" dialog widget
- Clean up the code, separate the game logic from the graphics stuff

What should be done someday

- Tilesets
- 3 or 4 players support
- A webpage for the game
- Saving/Resuming
- About dialog
- Are you sure? on some places
