<h3>Dealing the Cards</h3>

<p>
  La Pocha is a Spanish card game for four. The card set used is non­standard:
  the 7s, 8s, and 9s are removed in order to create a deck of size forty.
</p>

<p>
  Dealing proceeds in order from a randomly chosen person. The responsibility
  for dealing the cards circulates among the players in counterclockwise
  fashion.  The number of cards dealt depends on which hand is being played.
  It is easier to simply list the hand sizes, rather than explain them; here
  is the list:<br>
  <center>
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10,
     9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  </center>
</p>

<p>
  After the cards are dealt, the remainder of the deck is cut to determine
  the trump suit for the hand.  During the middle four hands of the game, where
  all forty cards are dealt, there will be no cards left to cut.  When this
  occurs, the dealer is presented with the opportunity to choose the trump
  suit after looking at his cards.
</p>

<h3>Bidding</h3>

<p>
  The person to the left of the dealer starts the bidding stage, declaring
  the number of tricks he will take. Bidding continues around the circle,
  until it reaches the dealer. There is a restriction placed on the dealer's
  bid: the number of tricks that he bids may not make the total tricks bid
  equal to the total number of tricks in the hand.
</p>

<table align="center" width="90%">
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">
    Example A:
  </td>
  <td>
    Assume that one card is dealt to each player, and that the first three
    bids are 1, 0, and 0 (total of one). The dealer, in this case, is forbidden
    to bid that he will not take a trick, even if he is certain he could not
    do so, as this would cause the total bid to equal one.
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">
    Example B:
  </td>
  <td>
    Assume that eight cards are dealt to each player, and that the first three
    bids are 3, 2, and 0 (total of five). The dealer, in this case, is forbidden
    to bid three tricks, as this would cause the total bid to equal eight.
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  No player can bid more tricks than the number of cards in his hand.  This
  may seem <i>obvious</i> but it could be to his advantage to do so if he were
  trying to reach a final score of zero - thus there is an explicit rule
  against doing so.
</p>

<h3>Game Play</h3>

<p>
  Game play proceeds much as any other "meet your bid" type of game.  First
  the player to the dealer's left plays an initial card.  Play then continues
  clockwise to the left.  Players must follow the suit of the first card played
  in each trick.  As is typical, the highest card in the led suit takes the
  trick unless a trump card was played - in which case the highest trump card
  wins the trick.
<p>

<p>
  If a player does not have the suit which was led, then he <i>must</i> play
  a higher trump card than any trump card currently on the table.  If he
  cannot play a higher trump, then he may choose not to play trump.
</p>

<table align="center" width="90%">
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">
    Example A:
  </td>
  <td>
    Assume the following game-play:
    <ul>
      <li>Spades is trump</li>
      <li>Player 1 plays a Heart</li>
      <li>Player 2 follows with a Heart</li>
      <li>Player 3 has no Hearts and trumps with King of Spades</li>
    </ul>
    If player 4 has no Hearts, but his highest Spade is a Jack, then he may
    choose to play the Jack or a card of another (non-trump) suit.  If he
    has a Heart, he must play it.
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">
    Example B:
  </td>
  <td>
    Assume the following game-play:
    <ul>
      <li>Clubs is trump</li>
      <li>Player 1 plays a Diamond</li>
      <li>Player 2 has no Diamonds or trump, and plays a Heart</li>
      <li>Player 3 has no Diamonds, and plays the Two of Clubs</li>
      <li>Player 4 bid one trick and has already made it</li>
    </ul>
    If player 4 has no Diamonds, he must play trump as long as he has any
    trump card higher than the 2, <i>even though</i> he has already made his
    bid and it is not in his best interests to trump.
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Winning the Game</h3>

<p>
  Scoring is handled as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>Each player which bids correctly (precisely the proper number of tricks)
        gets ten points, plus five points for each trick they bid.</li>
    <li>Each player which bids incorrectly (too many or too few tricks taken)
        loses five points per trick they bid.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Winning conditions:
  <ul>
    <li>The player with the greatest number points wins.</li>
    <li>If a player should achieve exactly zero points when all play is
        complete, they are deemed to be the winner. </li>
  </ul>
