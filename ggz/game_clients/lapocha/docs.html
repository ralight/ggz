<p>
La Pocha is a Spanish card game for four. The card set used is non­standard: the 
7s, 8s, and 9s are removed in order to create a deck of size forty.
</p>

<p>
Dealing proceeds in order from a randomly chosen person in the usual order. The responsibility
for dealing the cards circulates among the players in counterclockwise fashion. It is easier to
simply list the hand sizes, rather than explain them; here is the list<br>
<div align=center>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
</div>
</p>

<p>
After the cards are dealt, the deck is cut. The suit of the card that appears as a result of the cut
becomes the trump suit for that hand. During hands where each player is dealt 10 cards, there will
be no cards to cut, thus the dealer gets to choose the trump suit (after having looked at his cards).
</p>

<p>
The person to the left of the dealer starts the bidding stage, declaring the number of tricks she will
take. Bidding continues around the circle, until it reaches the dealer. There is one restriction
placed on the dealer's bid: the number of tricks that she bids may not make the total tricks bid
equal to the total number of tricks in the hand.<br>
Example:
<blockquote>
Assume that 3 cards are dealt to each player, and that the first three bids are 1, 0, and 1.<br>
The dealer, in this case, cannot bid to take 1 trick.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
No player can bid on more tricks that are in circulation that hand.<br>
Example:
<blockquote>
Assume that three cards are dealt to each player. No one player can bid for more than 3
tricks.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Scoring is handled as follows: if a player bids correctly, they get 10 + 5n points (where n is the
number of tricks bid); if a player bids incorrectly, they lose 5n points.
</p>

<p>
Winning conditions:
<ul>
	<li>the player with the greatest number points wins;</li>
	<li>if a player should achieve exactly 0 points when all play is complete, they are deemed to be
		the winner. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Play starts to the left of the dealer and proceeds in a counterclockwise direction. Players must
follow suit somewhat like hearts. The difference between the two games lies in the fact that there
is a trump suit. When a player does not have any cards of the suit in play, he must play a trump
card if he has one. There is one exception to the immediately above rule: if someone else has
already played a higher trump than the highest one a player has, he may choose to not play trump.<br>
Example:
<ul>
	<li>spades is trump;</li>
	<li>player 1 plays hearts;</li>
	<li>player 2 plays hearts;</li>
	<li>player 3 plays king of spades (no hearts);</li>
	<li>player 4 has only 10, J of spades, thus he can play spades, or anything else.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The highest in­suit card takes the trick, unless trump is played, in which case the highest trump
card takes the trick.
