 * This file contains headers for the AI for the ggzcards client.  Drop in
 * any one of the server ai files, and it should work.  Useful for debugging.
 *
 * This file contains the AI functions for playing any game.
 * The AI routines follow the none-too-successful algorithm of
 * always picking a random move.  At least they'll work with any
 * game!
