	- Updated documentation files

2002-04-12 15:56  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/module.dsc.in: - keep dots version at 0.0.2 (it was
	decreased to 0.0.1 ;)

2002-04-12 15:43  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/module.dsc.in: - upping Hastings client version

2002-04-12 13:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	protocol engine version numbers.

2002-04-12 02:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_about.c: Bumped the version number to 0.0.5 in the
	about dialog too.  Ugh!

2002-04-12 01:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/module.dsc.in: Bumped GGZCards version to 0.0.5.

2002-04-11 04:38  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/: chess/de.po, combat/de.po, dots/de.po, ggzcards/de.po,
	hastings/de.po, reversi/de.po, tictactoe/de.po: - apply German
	translations done by Sebastian Roth (http://www.xsebbi.de)

2002-04-10 21:50  Ricardo Quesada <riq@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/tictactoe/es_AR.po: updated spanish translation

2002-04-10 21:45  Ricardo Quesada <riq@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/ggzcards/es_AR.po: added spanish (argentinian) translation

2002-04-10 21:29  Ricardo Quesada <riq@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/hastings/es_AR.po: updated translation

2002-04-09 16:23  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/: control, rules: - finalize gtk+ games

2002-04-08 13:57  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/control: - update more control files

2002-04-07 20:02  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/cb_main.c: In La Pocha, pop up the exit confirmation
	dialog even in the WAIT state.	This means we'll see it while we're
	waiting during a game (good), but also while we're waiting for a
	game to start (bad).

2002-04-07 06:20  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/: postinst, prerm: - use --modfile, not --fromfile

2002-04-07 04:59  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* debian/.cvsignore: - update .cvsignore

2002-04-06 12:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: Makefile.am, cards-b1.xpm, cards-b2.xpm, cards-b3.xpm,
	cards-b4.xpm, cards.xpm, table.c: Remove duplicate cards xpm's from
	La Pocha: it just uses the cards from the ggzcards directory
	directly.
	
	I had lap use the ggzcards files instead of the other way around
	because ggzcards uses additional rotated XPM files of the card
	fronts.  It is possible the XPM files should go in the gtk-games
	common directory (?).
	
	These XPM files are 500k in size, so removing the duplicate is a
	least potentially a big saver in tarball size.	But a better
	solution would be to have the images be converted to .png files and
	installed in a common location - that way the installation/binary
	size could be kept down as well.

2002-04-06 09:39  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: - sync acinclude.ggz

2002-04-05 16:03  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* QuickStart.GGZ, README.GGZ: - update installation instructions
	and overview

2002-04-05 01:09  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common/shared.h: Updated common code that was changed at
	the server end: added a MAX() macro.

2002-04-04 02:49  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/Makefile.am: - include the "common" directory (e.g. the quit
	dialog) for all translations

2002-04-04 02:48  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/spades/: de.po, spades.pot: - add German translation for
	spades

2002-04-04 02:47  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: client_func.c, client_main.c, gtk_dlg_about.c,
	gtk_dlg_disconnect.c, gtk_dlg_error.c, gtk_dlg_options.c,
	gtk_dlg_stat.c, gtk_io.c, gtk_menu.c, gtk_play.c: - i18n for
	NetSpades - bugfix: Close Gdk handler for network connection if an
	error occurs

2002-04-04 02:01  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/Makefile.am: - include new translations in build process

2002-04-04 02:01  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/: lapocha/de.po, lapocha/lapocha.pot,
	chinese-checkers/chinese-checkers.pot, chinese-checkers/de.po: -
	add gtk+ game translations for lapocha and chinese-checkers

2002-04-04 01:59  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: dlg_about.c, dlg_bid.c, dlg_main.c, game.c, main.c: -
	game translation

2002-04-03 11:44  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/module.dsc.in, chinese-checkers/module.dsc.in,
	combat/module.dsc.in, dots/module.dsc.in, ggzcards/module.dsc.in,
	lapocha/module.dsc.in, reversi/module.dsc.in,
	tictactoe/module.dsc.in: - some more homepage URL updates

2002-04-03 11:28  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: For consistency, handle ENABLE_NLS with
	AC_DEFINE (like all the other macros) instead of CFLAGS="$CFLAGS
	-DENABLE_NLS".
	
	This will naturally take care of any rebuilding dependencies when
	NSL is toggled, which the other method did not do.

2002-04-03 11:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common/: ggzintl.c, ggzintl.h: - Added header comment to
	ggzintl.[ch].  - Moved "#include <config.h>" up to the top of
	ggzintl.c, so it'll be	 included first and will affect all other
	inclusions.  - Added "#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H" check.  - Removed
	#inclusion of stdio.h, which does not seem necessary.

2002-04-03 11:15  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common/: dlg_exit.c, dlg_exit.h: Fixed file name in header
	comment.

2002-03-28 12:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: game.h, main.c, main_win.c: Some improvements and fixes
	to Reversi:
	
	  - Pop up a confirmation dialog when we try to exit during a game.
	  - Because of this, I had to move the conf parsing code out of
	main_win.c
	    and into main().  Instead of calling ggz_conf_read_string and
	then
	    doing a sscanf() on it, I changed this to just be
	ggz_conf_read_int
	    (and a similar change for the saving code).
	  - I changed (GGZ_CONF_RDRW || GGZ_CONF_CREATE) to
	    (GGZ_CONF_RDRW | GGZ_CONF_CREATE) so that the config stuff
	actually
	    works now.	Yay!

2002-03-28 02:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h: Added GGZ-style header comments
	to the (non-glade-controlled) callback files in Chess.

2002-03-28 02:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h: In Combat, pop up a
	confirmation dialog any time the player tries to exit.

2002-03-28 02:14  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: Makefile.am, cb_main.c: In La Pocha, pop up a
	confirmation dialog when we try to exit during a game.

2002-03-28 02:01  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/cb_main.c: Pop up an exit confirmation dialog in dots when
	we try to exit during a game.

2002-03-28 01:37  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/main_cb.c: Show an exit dialog when the player
	tries to leave chinese-checkers.
	
	In theory, this should only be shown when a game is in progress. 
	But I don't see how to tell this from the client end.

2002-03-28 01:32  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/: game.c, game.h: game.theme is initially read
	in by ggz_conf_read_string, which means it's allocated by
	ggz_malloc.  Therefore it must be freed with ggz_free (not g_free
	or free), and allocated later by ggz_strdup (not strdup).  Doing
	differently leads to a segfault when we try to change themes.

2002-03-28 01:25  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/: game.h, main.c: Removed (commented out) two
	unused variables from struct game_t: state and got_players.
	
	It appears that we never actually know the game state, and
	got_players is tracked locally (statically) within the
	player-name-reading function.

2002-03-28 01:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/callbacks.c: Only pop up the exit dialog if our state is
	CHESS_STATE_PLAYING.

2002-03-27 21:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h, game.c, game.h, module.dsc.in,
	preferences.c, client/client.c, client/client.h, common/cards.c,
	common/cards.h, common/protocol.c, common/protocol.h,
	common/shared.h: More tooltips madness.  Introduced the concept of
	a bid description, separate from the simple bid text.  Send the bid
	descriptions to the client when requesting a bid.  At the client
	end, show these descriptions as tooltips if that preference is
	selected.
	
	I added bid descriptions for Suaro and Spades, other games do not
	have them yet.

2002-03-27 19:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, game.c, game.h,
	module.dsc.in, client/client.c, client/client.h, common/cards.c,
	common/cards.h, common/protocol.c, common/protocol.h,
	common/shared.h: Now each option set has a single descriptive text
	associated with it.  This text is sent to the clients, and is
	displayed by the gtk client as a tooltip for all of the relevant
	option choices.

2002-03-27 18:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/game.c: Improved the syntax of many statusbar messages.

2002-03-27 18:11  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, game.h, preferences.c: Added confirm_exit
	preference.

2002-03-27 18:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: There was a buglet when we show the bid
	choices on the table: the label at the top of the bid selection
	table that says "Select your bid:" isn't drawn correctly when it's
	placed directly on the table.  (Justin tells me this is because a
	GtkLabel doesn't have its own GdkWindow.)
	
	The workaround is to just not show that label when we have
	bid_on_table.  This is acceptable since the statusbar at the bottom
	of the table still already says something similar.  It also has the
	advantage that more bids can fit on the table area, so the
	bid_on_table option will work for more games (in fact, it now works
	for suaro for me).

2002-03-27 02:30  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/preferences.c: Changed default preferencecs: faster and
	smoother animation, and show the bid choices on the table.
	
	The only thing questionable is showing the bid choices on the
	table, which doesn't work cleanly for suaro.

2002-03-26 01:13  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_prefs.c, preferences.c, preferences.h: Added
	tooltips for the preferences.  They should all be translated
	properly, etc., although this is untested.
	
	Perhaps this can be the start of some gratuitous overuse of
	tooltips in ggzcards...

2002-03-26 00:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/: Makefile.am, about_dlg.c, game.c, main.c:
	Added some i18n support for chinese-checkers.
	
	I did not mess with the glade-generated files, but I did change the
	text of the other files to be translated, set the locale to
	chinese-checkers, and used ggzintl.h with the libgtk-games.a
	library.

2002-03-25 16:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, dlg_about.c, dlg_bid.c, dlg_main.c,
	dlg_options.c, dlg_players.c, dlg_prefs.c, game.c, game.h, main.c,
	preferences.c: Enable i18n in ggzcards:   - Remove local
	definicions of intl macros/functions.	 - #include "ggzintl.h" in
	a lot of files.    - Change some _(...) that was used in a
	non-executing context to N_(...).    - Call ggz_intl_init().  In
	theory, this is all that is needed for localization of client-side
	messages to work.  Of course, most messages are still generated on
	the server and cannot yet be translated.

2002-03-24 12:41  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: - add todo list for gtk-games

2002-03-24 11:40  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	dots/Makefile.am, reversi/Makefile.am, reversi/main.c,

	hastings/Makefile.am, hastings/ggzintl.c, hastings/ggzintl.h,
	tictactoe/Makefile.am, tictactoe/ggzintl.c, tictactoe/ggzintl.h: -
	move ggzintl to the new common/ dir

2002-03-24 11:12  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/Makefile.am: - more i18n subdirs

2002-03-24 11:10  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/ggzintl.c, tictactoe/ggzintl.c: - use LOCALEDIR

2002-03-24 11:09  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/: chess/chess.pot, chess/de.po, combat/combat.pot,

	reversi/reversi.pot, tictactoe/de.po, tictactoe/es_AR.po,
	tictactoe/pt_BR.po, tictactoe/tictactoe.pot: - i18n'ize
	ggz-gtk-games - some games are not prepared for translation yet!

2002-03-24 11:05  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: - use LOCALEDIR

2002-03-24 11:00  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/ggzintl.c: - use LOCALDIR in ggzintl

2002-03-23 19:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, cb_main.c: Use the common exit dialog to
	double-check if we want to exit, but only if we've already started
	a game.  (If we've finished one game but haven't started another,
	it will pop up the dialog.  This isn't perfect, but we don't
	currently track whether we're actually playing a game.	It should
	be fine for now.)

2002-03-23 18:56  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common/dlg_exit.c: Change the exit dialog so that new exit
	dialogs won't pop up if a user tries to exit multiple times.

2002-03-23 18:49  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/: Makefile.am, main_win.c: Change hastings to use the
	common exit dialog.

2002-03-23 14:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/: ggzintl.h, main.c, main_win.c, main_win.h: Tell the
	player the color of their units/team, instead of just a player
	number.

2002-03-23 14:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* common/dlg_exit.c: Show (slightly) different text if can_return
	is specified to ggz_show_exit_dialog().

2002-03-23 14:04  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/callbacks.c: Oops!  Added missing #include.

2002-03-23 14:02  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: Makefile.am, callbacks.c, callbacks.h, main_win.c,
	glade/ggz.chess.glade: Changed chess to call ggz_show_exit_dialog()
	instead of exiting when the user attempts to close the client. 
	This meant editing the glade file to change the callback for the
	delete event, and changing this callback and the on_exit_activate()
	one to call ggz_show_exit_dialog().  I named the new callback
	ExitDialog, which unfortunately doesn't match any of the other
	chess function names (though it does match the identical netspades
	version).
	
	It might be a good idea to have the client first check to see if a
	game is in progress before popping up the dialog.  If there's not,
	it might as well just go ahead and exit.

2002-03-23 13:31  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in, common/.cvsignore, common/Makefile.am,
	common/dlg_exit.c, common/dlg_exit.h, spades/Makefile.am,
	spades/callbacks.c, spades/callbacks.h, spades/gtk_dlg_exit.c,
	spades/gtk_dlg_exit.h, spades/gtk_io.c, spades/gtk_menu.c: Put new
	library libgtk-games.a into directory common/.	Moved NetSpades'
	exit dialog into this library, and linked NetSpades to it.
	
	The library now contains the ggz_show_exit_dlg() function.  In time
	it can hold others as well, so that gtk-games all have a common
	feel.
	
	I added a wrapper function to NetSpades so that the library
	function can have a straightforward interface.	This is the only
	actual code change I did; everything else was just moving code
	around.

2002-03-23 12:36  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h: Added header comments for
	callbacks.[ch].

2002-03-23 12:04  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/gtk_dlg_exit.c: Remove some unnecessary #include
	directives so that the exit dialog doesn't depend on other
	NetSpades files.
	
	Also remove some unnecessary blank lines.

2002-03-23 11:56  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/: Makefile.am, main_win.c, shadow.xpm: - display own
	player as knight with bright sword

2002-03-21 07:08  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_main.c: Partially changed menus to use
	GtkItemFactory.  Disabled for now.

2002-03-21 05:10  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-03-17 18:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/gtk_dlg_exit.c: Give a stronger warning about players
	leaving NetSpades during the game.

2002-03-16 18:14  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: main.c, module.dsc.in, client/client.c,
	client/client.h, common/protocol.c, common/protocol.h: Step 1 of
	adding i18n support to GGZCards: have the clients send their
	language setting to the server.
	
	Notes:	 - This is actually the only step that needs be taken now,
	since it     breaks protocol compatibility.  All other changes need
	only be done	 server-side.	 - It doesn't technically "work",
	since the packet sent by the client	 is not delivered by GGZ. 
	This will be an easy way to test any bug      fix for that problem.

2002-03-15 08:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/cb_main.c: Changed the expose event signal handler to
	return TRUE instead of FALSE.
	
	This will prevent handling of the event by the widget's parent
	(which is probably harmless but unnecessary).

2002-03-15 08:39  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/cb_main.c: Return TRUE in the expose event signal
	handler.  This prevents further handling by the widget's parents
	(which should be harmless but is unnecessary.

2002-02-27 03:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, common/Makefile.am, common/cards.c,
	common/cards.h, common/protocol.c, common/protocol.h,
	common/shared.h: Split up common code into multiple files.

2002-02-27 02:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, table.c, client/client.c, client/client.h,
	common/protocol.c, common/protocol.h: Moved "hand" structure into
	common code (which is still protocol.h, unfortunately).

2002-02-25 18:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: layout.c, layout.h, main.c: Made the card overlap
	amount a globally defined constant, rather than hard-coding it
	everywhere.

2002-02-25 08:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: module.dsc.in, common/Makefile.am, common/protocol.c,
	common/protocol.h: Added a new card parameter, "type".
	
	This can store the type of the deck.  Currently we only support
	standard (French) decks, but in theory any deck type could work. 
	(I'd like to prove it by implementing a game using dominoes as the
	deck, but it'll take extra work to get the graphics to work.)

2002-02-25 04:15  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, client/Makefile.am: Add all sorts of
	$(top_srcdir) madness so that a "make distcheck" will work.
	
	Of course, it still fails later on...

2002-02-25 03:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/Makefile.am: Fixed duplicate INCLUDES directive.

2002-02-25 03:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: dded Makefiles for new directories to autoconf
	process.

2002-02-25 03:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, client.c, client.h, protocol.c,
	protocol.h, client/.cvsignore, client/Makefile.am, client/client.c,
	client/client.h, common/.cvsignore, common/Makefile.am,
	common/protocol.c, common/protocol.h: Moved "common" and "client
	common" code into its own directories.
	
	This code is all still contained in one file right now, but it need
	not be (and in most cases should not be).

2002-02-24 13:57  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: client.c, client.h, game.c, game.h, module.dsc.in,
	protocol.h: Changed the game-specific messages to send the game
	_name_ instead of an (arbitrary) game-identifying opcode.

2002-02-24 13:28  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, protocol.c, protocol.h: Updated common files
	from server.

2002-02-20 20:53  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, animation.h, client.c, client.h,
	common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c, dlg_options.c, game.c, game.h,
	layout.c, main.c, main.h, table.c: Updated client-common files from
	their changes in the server AI code.
	
	- This means, for one, that they no longer use ggzmod (!) but
	access FD   3 directly.  - Consequently, I renamed them as
	client.[ch].  This is much better than	 having server and client
	both contain common.[ch].  - I changed the debugging system
	slightly.  Debugging type "core-error"	 was removed; instead I
	just use ggz_error_msg instead.

2002-02-19 08:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: protocol.c, protocol.h: Moved function cards_equal to
	are_cards_equal in the "common" code, so it'll be accessible from
	the client.

2002-02-19 07:06  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c, game.h, module.dsc.in:
	Changed the REQ_BID bid request packet to include a list of the
	actual bids available, in addition to the bid descriptive texts.

2002-02-19 06:04  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c, game.h, module.dsc.in,
	protocol.c, protocol.h: Added MSG_NEWHAND new hand message, sent
	from the server to the client to inform them of a new bid.
	
	This will generally not be used by the GUI, which really doesn't
	need to know this information at all.  But it could be used by a
	client-side AI.

2002-02-19 04:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c, game.h, module.dsc.in,
	protocol.c, protocol.h: Added MSG_BID bid message, sent from the
	server to the client to inform them of a bid.
	
	This will generally not be used by the GUI, which (in the most
	general case) will rely on the player messages for this information
	instead.  But it could be used by a specialized GUI or a
	client-side AI.

2002-02-17 10:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_players.c: Fixed bug: added handling of
	GGZ_SEAT_NONE in update_player_clist().

2002-02-17 10:51  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, table.c, table.h: Added player list to splash
	screen and in between games.
	
	I've temporarily disabled any kind of real splash screen, since the
	drawing doesn't mesh with having a player list on the screen.  But
	we'll see...

2002-02-17 09:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_main.c,
	dlg_players.c, dlg_players.h, game.c: Added player list dialog
	window, controlled by the "Player List" entry in the Game menu.

2002-02-17 09:14  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Removed bad assertion in draw_splash_screen().

2002-02-17 07:28  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_main.c: Added "Force Redraw"
	selection to Game menu.
	
	Unfortunately (!), I can't manage to get myself into a situation
	where I need to force a redraw, so I can't tell if this is
	necessary.  But it should work.

2002-02-17 07:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, dlg_prefs.c, game.c, game.h, main.c,
	preferences.c, preferences.h: Moved to generalized preferences
	system.
	
	The pref_types array holds the list of preferences.
	
	Only booleans are currently supported.

2002-02-17 06:13  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Avoid ggz_malloc'ing and ggz_free'ing a size-0
	piece of memory.

2002-02-17 03:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/display.c, chinese-checkers/game.c,
	chinese-checkers/main.c, reversi/main.c, reversi/main_win.c,
	spades/client_func.c, spades/gtk_dlg_stat.c: Polishing cleanups to
	the debugging system:	- Removed a lot of trailing \n newlines
	from ggz_debug calls.	 - Change some printf calls that were
	hiding into ggz_debug calls.	- In chinese checkers, fixed
	game_print_board (which is currently	  disabled) so that it will
	work with ggz_debug.	- Changed the default debugging type in
	Reversi to be "main" instead	  of "reversi", to match all the
	other games.	- Added a missing #include <ggz.h> to
	spades/client_func.c.	 - (off-topic) fixed a spurious compiler
	warning in	spades/gtk_dlg_stat.c by initializing noButton when
	it's not going	    to be used.

2002-02-17 03:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Change the autoconf (automake?) process
	so that we get a #define NDEBUG if debugging is not enabled.
	
	There will therefore be _either_ #define DEBUG or #define NDEBUG in
	config.h.  With DEBUG, we get full debugging output and assertions.
	 With NDEBUG, we get neither.  It would be possible to make an
	intermediate state that defined neither - then assertions would
	run, but we could (at our option) have little or no debugging
	output.

2002-02-17 03:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/: ggzintl.c, main.c, main_win.c: Changed hastings to use
	libggz's logging/debugging routines.

2002-02-17 03:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: game.c, main.c, map.c: Changed combat to use libggz's
	logging/debugging routines.

2002-02-17 03:17  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: game.c, main.c, net.c: Changed Chess to use libggz's
	logging/debugging routines.

2002-02-17 02:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: client_func.c, client_main.c, socketfunc.c: Changed
	spades to use libggz's logging/debugging routines.

2002-02-17 02:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/main.c: Changed La Pocha to use libggz's
	logging/debugging routines.
	
	Also, I #ifdef'd out an unused function to avoid a compiler
	warning.

2002-02-17 02:36  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, main.c: Changed dots to use libggz's
	logging/debugging routines.

2002-02-17 02:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/: display.c, game.c, main.c: Changed chinese
	checkers to use libggz's debugging routines.
	
	Mostly this involved switching a lot of fprintf to ggz_error_msg
	calls.

2002-02-17 02:20  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/main.c: Only do GGZ_CHECK_MEM if DEBUG is specified.

2002-02-17 02:15  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: - Only do GGZ_CHECK_MEM if DEBUG is specified. 
	- Move debug_cleanup up next to initialize_debugging.

2002-02-17 02:02  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: main.c, main_win.c: Changed printf output to use
	ggz_debug instead.  Sent debugging output to
	~/.ggz/reversi-gtk.debug, and disabled most debugging when DEBUG is
	not specified.

2002-02-17 01:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, main.c, table.c, table.h: Add further
	cleanup routines before we exit, so that the memory check will be
	clean.

2002-02-16 20:05  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, dlg_prefs.c, game.c, game.h,
	main.c: Significant changes to the animation system:   - When we
	receive a MSG_TRICK message, we won't interrupt an on-table    
	animation to begin the off-table animation.  Instead we mark the   
	 off-table animation to be handled once the on-table animation is  
	  completed.	- We manually delay before starting the off-table
	animation after      receiving a MSG_TRICK (and after the on-table
	animation is	  completed).  The delay is either 1 or 2 seconds,
	depending on	  the "longer_clearing_delay" preference.  This is
	accomplished with      a bit of a hack; instead of queuing future
	events for handling after      the one-second delay, we just ignore
	the server during this time.  In      some situations (i.e. bridge)
	this could result in a bit of a buildup      of unhandled data, but
	I don't think it should be too much.

2002-02-14 22:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: Add a "select your bid" label above the bid
	selection, both for on-the-table and dialog window bidding.

2002-02-14 22:36  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: Fixed division-by-zero error in the
	calculating of the bid selection dimensions.

2002-02-14 22:25  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_bid.c, dlg_prefs.c, game.c, game.h, layout.c,
	layout.h, main.c: Place the bid selection box directly onto the
	table, rather than in a separate dialog window - if the
	bid_on_table preference is set (turned off by default).
	
	There may be problems with this system - for one thing, if there
	are too many bids (like in Suaro and Bridge) they might not fit on
	the table at all.  There may be drawing issues as well - we'll see.
	 This is why it's not enabled by default, although it is much more
	convnient than the separate window.

2002-02-14 04:51  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, common.c, common.h, game.c,
	main.c, main.h: Added animation to move cards off the table.

2002-02-14 01:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: gdk_string.diff, table.c: OK, forget holding on to the
	patch.	The behavior of the new code is so much better it justifies
	all the pain of dealing with GDK strings...

2002-02-14 00:06  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/gdk_string.diff: Well, this patch adds something under
	100 lines to the code...but it redoes the table so that it is all
	done with GDK, i.e. no GtkLabels are used for the player texts.
	
	This makes the animations prettier since the texts don't get
	overdrawn.  If I decide to use it, it would be easy to then make
	the whole table a GtkPixmap, which should fix all of the drawing
	issues.

2002-02-13 15:32  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, dlg_prefs.c, game.h, main.c,
	table.c: Significant change to the animation code: now it is
	possible to have more than one animation at once.  If a new card is
	played while one was already being animated, then both cards are
	animated.
	
	This has a tendancy to interfere with the GtkLabels that sit on the
	table, so I've made it an option disabled by default.

2002-02-13 03:53  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/animation.c: Changed the animation process: instead of
	tracking the current position and a "step" for the movement each
	animation, we track the number of the current frame and
	re-calculate the position each frame.
	
	This makes calculations significantly more sane, since we don't
	have to worry about floating values or having our endpoints match
	up.

2002-02-13 03:15  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, dlg_prefs.c, game.h, main.c: Added two
	new preferences to control animation.

2002-02-13 02:58  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, table.c, table.h: Added a
	separate "animation buffer".  Now animation drawing is buffered,
	and will flicker less.
	
	This is similar to the double-buffering used by lapocha, that I
	removed (from ggzcards) when I disabled animations long ago.

2002-02-13 01:32  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Workaround for bug.
	
	When table_setup is called, we expect the game to have started, so
	there's an assertion to that effect.  But, if we join a game in
	progress we get no MSG_NEWGAME alert so game_started will not have
	been set.
	
	The workaround is to change the assertion to instead set
	game_started and log an error message.	But this should be fixed
	server-side.

2002-02-12 22:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/game.c: Fixed buglet - when we get a BADPLAY message
	from the server, we need to redraw the cards on the table (in
	addition to the cards-in-hand, which were already redrawn).

2002-02-12 20:48  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, cards-1.xpm, cards-2.xpm,
	cards-3.xpm, cards-4.xpm, cards-b1.xpm, cards-b2.xpm, cards-b3.xpm,
	cards-b4.xpm, cb_main.c, cb_main.h, common.c, common.h,
	dlg_about.c, dlg_about.h, dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h, dlg_main.c,
	dlg_main.h, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, dlg_prefs.c, dlg_prefs.h,
	game.c, game.h, layout.c, layout.h, main.c, main.h, protocol.c,
	protocol.h, table.c, table.h: Updated copyright and author
	information for each file.

2002-02-12 19:34  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Fixed errors in --disable-FEATURE options, for
	gettext and debug.
	
	The format is AC_ARG_ENABLE(feature, descriptive_text,
	if_specified,				  if_not_specified). 
	descriptive_text seems to have nothing to do with the rest.  If the
	parameter is specified, we don't want to do anything - just let
	configure it out.  If it's _not_ specified, then we need to give a
	default (which we do).
	
	The problem before was that there was an action given for
	if_specified - which will lock us in to that action, no matter what
	is actually specified.
	
	Anyway, it should work now.

2002-02-12 17:30  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_prefs.c: Fixed Capitalization and grammar in
	cardlist preferences.

2002-02-12 17:23  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_prefs.c, game.c: Enabled "Show Graphical
	Cardlists" preference - but it doesn't take effect immediately.

2002-02-11 17:26  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Switch the code to increase the maximum hand
	size back to using realloc instead of just mallocing the new hand
	and accepting a memory leak.  This used to cause a segfault from
	time to time, but now it should not.
	
	In hindsight, it's obvious why things happened as they did. 
	Becasue the buffer overrun on the hand was just 1 card (3 bytes),
	most of the time it didn't affect anything and was untraceable. 
	Only for particular hand sizes did things line up so that the
	overrun mangled malloc's internal memory, and caused a crash.

2002-02-11 17:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Fixed major big mondo bug: an off-by-one error
	causing a slight buffer overrun.
	
	Guess what?  I bet this fixes all of the lingering memory problem
	bugs.

2002-02-11 06:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Cast more ignored function return values to
	(void).

2002-02-11 06:46  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, layout.c, main.c, table.c,
	table.h: Made some variables and functions static.

2002-02-11 04:52  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, dlg_about.c, dlg_bid.c, dlg_main.c,
	dlg_options.c, dlg_prefs.c, main.c: Added (void) cast to many
	functions whose return values are ignored.

2002-02-11 03:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, common.c, game.c, game.h, table.c:
	Assorted improvements and bugfixes.
	
	  - Added several more assertions, to animation_start() and
	    get_card_coordinates() (this is a good one).
	  - Fixed animation: now when we play a card, table_cards isn't
	updated
	    until after the animation starts.  When the animation is
	complete,
	    the card will be actually drawn on the table.  If
	animation_start is
	    called again, it will return without starting if the card is
	already
	    in table_cards.  Therefore the bug whereby an animation would
	be done
	    twice should be fixed.
	  - A minor cleanup to the code for a MSG_TABLE; behavior shouldn't
	be
	    changed.
	  - When ggzcards.players is allocated, initialize all values in it
	-
	    especially table_card, which will otherwise be left invalid.

2002-02-11 02:52  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: protocol.c, protocol.h: Updated common files from
	server - added checking and debugging code to read_card and
	write_card.

2002-02-11 01:24  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c, table.c: Reset
	ggzcards.play_hand to -1 when we're not playing, and add a number
	of assertions to make sure this invariant is maintained.
	
	I also added a comment in the struct definition explaining this.

2002-02-11 00:55  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Cleanup to debugging messages about protocol
	opcodes.

2002-02-11 00:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: protocol.c, protocol.h: Added functions to get a
	string description of a protocol opcode, for debugging.

2002-02-11 00:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: When a play sent to us from the server has
	more than one possible match in the player's hand (which will occur
	when the hand is unknown, for instance), the card we pick as the
	match is now done semi-randomly.
	
	To get random behavior, I used random() and so added an srandom()
	call as well.
	
	This has the side effect of making animations prettier, since they
	will come from different places in the hand.

2002-02-10 23:55  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/animation.c: Fix a minor animation problem: when we
	animate a card of a player with horizontal cards-in-hand, the fact
	that we animate the card vertically means it's necessary to move
	the card slightly so it's center appears the same.
	
	This has a side effect of fixing a drawing problem in some cases,
	where the animation ran over the player labels.  But I wouldn't
	really call it a "fix".

2002-02-10 23:06  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c, game.h, table.c: I
	separated the GUI tracking of the cards on the table from the core
	client's tracking of such cards.    - I added a lengthy comment
	describing ggzcards.players[p].table_card.    - I created a new
	array, table_cards, with which the GUI tracks the      cards on the
	table.	This will _not_ mesh with what the core code	  tracks
	through ggzcards.players[p].table_card.  The core code's      data
	just mirrors what the server sends us, while the GUI's data	 is
	intended to track what we're actually drawing (which may be	
	different if we're animating, etc.).	- The animation bugs will
	still be present, since the animation code has	    not been
	changed to take advantage of the two separate pieces of data.

2002-02-10 21:21  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_prefs.c, game.c, game.h, main.c: Added
	use_default_options preference.  When enabled, the client will
	always automatically pick the default options for a game without
	popping up a window.  This will make debugging runs just a little
	bit faster.
	
	Also, I fixed a couple of typo mistakes in the code for the other
	preferences.

2002-02-10 21:05  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, game.c: Remove table card resetting out of
	handle_msg_badplay(), and into game_alert_badplay().  This will
	have no end result (since the one just calls the other), but is
	logically clearer (since it is the table code that caused the need
	for a reset by interfering with the core code's tracking of the
	cards).

2002-02-10 20:39  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Fixed bug: when we received a play message
	from the server (indicating a player had played a card), we didn't
	actually place the card on the table.
	
	This probably introduces a (lesser) bug elsewhere, but that's
	unavoidable.  I wrote an extensive comment about it.

2002-02-10 20:17  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Minor cleanup to table_redraw(): remove some
	#ifdef 0'd-out code, remove an unused variable, and add a comple
	more comments.

2002-02-10 19:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Make comparison of card-in-hand to table card
	explicit (rather than using memcmp, ugh) in table_display_hand().

2002-02-10 19:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, game.c, table.c, table.h: - Added
	write_to_screen parameter for various table_show_*** functions.   
	These functions draw to the backing store, and if write_to_screen
	is    specified they will propogate the changes straight out to the
	table	 window (which was the default before for most of them).  -
	Changed table_redraw so that when it calls table_show_*** it does
	_not_	specify write_to_screen.  Instead, at the end of the
	function we   manually call table_show_table() to redraw the whole
	thing.	This should   cut down (a very little) on flicker.

2002-02-10 18:44  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_main.c: - Renamed
	on_fixed1_style_set to on_fixed1_redraw_event.	- Connected
	on_fixed1_redraw_event to the size_allocate event, but	 disabled
	the code for now.

2002-02-10 07:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, table.c: Miscellaneous cleanups to redrawing
	code.	 - Disable table_redraw() hack in game_get_bid().    -
	Replace manual drawing code in table_setup() with a simple call to 
	    table_redraw().  This should make sure that the drawing
	(complete      with the "refresh hack" in table_redraw) happens
	correctly.
	
	As of this change, it is extremely likely that all redrawing works
	correctly (aside from flickering, which should really not be
	necessary).

2002-02-10 06:33  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Enable debugging by default.  Thus instead of
	--enable-debug as an option we have --disable-debug.

2002-02-10 06:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Miscellaneous cleanups to table-clearing code: 
	 - Created new function, table_clear_table to do the work.    -
	Call it in place of old gdk_draw_rectangle(...), in two places.   
	- Move table_clear_table out of draw_card_areas (WTF was it doing
	in	there anyway???).    - Fixed bug where draw_card_areas were
	being drawn _after_ the player	    hand information - I moved
	table_clear_table up above where the	  player data was drawn (in
	table_setup).

2002-02-10 06:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, table.c, table.h: Miscellaneous cleanups:	 -
	Changed 1 to TRUE.    - Added an assertion to draw_card_areas.	  -
	Moved all accesses of table_ready into table.c.    - Moved
	table_ready into table.c (and made it static).	  - Removed some
	excessive debugging text.

2002-02-10 05:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, common.c, layout.c, protocol.c: Added
	"#include <config.h>" for files that were missing it.

2002-02-10 05:03  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: protocol.c, protocol.h: Changed UNKNOWN_CARD from a
	#definition to a const card_t.

2002-02-10 00:20  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/animation.c: Fixed the type (gint->guint) of the cb_tag
	field of the anim struct.

2002-02-09 19:53  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, table.c, table.h: - Changed 0 to FALSE and 1
	to TRUE.  - Added some extra assertions.  - Changed one use of
	game_started to table_ready.

2002-02-09 19:51  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Fixed buglet/compiler warning: passing an
	enumeration value as an int*.

2002-02-09 19:37  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: At the end of the configure process, show whether
	gettext is enabled (along with debugging and GDB debugging, already
	present).

2002-02-09 19:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: main.c, main.h: - Added extra comments to many
	functions.  - Made statusbar_message take a const char* instead of
	a char*.

2002-02-09 17:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Added assertion and comment when resizing table
	buffer.

2002-02-05 16:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/main.c: Removed "#define GGZ_SEAT_OPEN -1" instruction,
	which was causing Reversi to completely fail.

2002-02-04 01:58  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/module.dsc.in, chinese-checkers/module.dsc.in,
	combat/game.c, combat/module.dsc.in, dots/module.dsc.in,
	ggzcards/module.dsc.in, hastings/module.dsc.in,
	lapocha/module.dsc.in, reversi/module.dsc.in,
	tictactoe/module.dsc.in: Upped the protocol version numbers on all
	games that use the GGZSeatType enumeration.
	
	AFAICT, this is all games except keepalive, spades, and muehle.
	
	I've done limited testing to make sure everything works as planned,
	but further testing would be good.

2002-02-04 01:56  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Removed check for and linkage to unused ggzcore
	library.

2002-02-03 14:32  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: Updated acinclude.ggz from changes made in ggzd.

2002-01-21 02:09  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in, chess/main.c, chess/net.c, chinese-checkers/game.c,
	chinese-checkers/main.c, combat/game.c, combat/main.c, dots/game.c,
	dots/main.c, ggzcards/Makefile.am, hastings/main.c, lapocha/game.c,
	lapocha/hand.c, lapocha/main.c, reversi/main.c, reversi/main_win.c,
	tictactoe/main.c: Switched over from easysock to libggz/easysock:
	
	- Changed all es_*** functions to ggz_***.  - Changed all #include
	<easysock.h> to #include <ggz.h>.  - Changed ggz_read_string_alloc
	functions to call ggz_free() instead of   free() on the allocated
	string.  Put FIXME comments by alloc calls that   don't seem to
	have associated free's.  - Added LIB_GGZ to the module's LDADD.  -
	Removed LIB_GGZ from ggzcards's LDADD.	- Removed autoconf check
	for easysock(0.3).

2002-01-20 02:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, cb_main.c, cb_main.h,
	common.c, common.h, dlg_about.c, dlg_about.h, dlg_main.c,
	dlg_main.h, dlg_prefs.c, dlg_prefs.h, game.c, game.h, layout.c,
	layout.h, main.c, main.h, protocol.c, table.c, table.h: Changed
	easysock calls to libggz/easysock ones.
	
	Also included are numerous other local cleanups.

2002-01-12 04:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in, ggzcards/Makefile.am: Added check for libggz.

2002-01-12 04:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: Added acinclude.ggz to ggzd and ggz-client-libs.

2002-01-12 04:04  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: Added libggz support to acinclude.ggz.

2002-01-11 11:11  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/: Makefile.am, dlg_about.c, dlg_about.h, dlg_yesno.c,
	dlg_yesno.h, game.h, main.c, main_win.c, main_win.h, module.dsc.in:
	- cleaned up the source a bit - added yes/no question when
	attempting to quit the game - updated copyrights

2002-01-09 06:47  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/game.c: - did I ever tell that vim makes
	:%s/ggzcore_confio/ggz_conf/g very easy? :-)

2002-01-09 06:45  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/map.c: - let combat also use ggz_conf

2002-01-09 06:44  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/main_win.c: - same for reversi: use ggz_conf

2002-01-09 06:41  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: - prepend GGZ_ to constants

2002-01-09 06:38  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, main.c: - let Dot use ggz_conf

2002-01-08 03:20  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: Added acinclude to utils/ module, and updated the
	years on the copyright notice.

2002-01-06 00:57  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Removed an assertion that fails because of a
	server problem - eventually I'll want to fix the problem, no doubt,
	but for now I've just removed it.

2001-12-22 22:21  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c: Removed function
	game_setup_table(); added function game_alert_num_players().  This
	makes it obvious that game_alert_max_hand_size() must also redesign
	the table (via table_setup()) since there's no explicit function to
	do that anymore.
	
	In summary, the client-common interface is a bit cleaner.

2001-12-22 21:02  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, game.h, table.c: Added game_started global
	variable to track whether we've actually started playing.  It isn't
	set to 1 until we start our first game.  If not set, then we keep
	the splash screen up.
	
	This fixes the buglet that caused the splash screen to be
	overwritten as we tried to draw empty tables, etc., over it.

2001-12-22 20:11  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Cleanup to table_initialize().

2001-12-22 18:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Fixed bug in tracking of table vs card
	coordinates.

2001-12-21 03:38  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, common.c, game.c, table.c, table.h:
	Numerous cleanups and fixes to the table card and animation
	systems.
	
	- Unified table card functions, getting rid of table_clear_table. 
	We   now leave the removing of the cards from the client-common
	data   structure up to the client-common code (as it should be).  -
	Try to make things work by fully redrawing the table when we have  
	a bad play.  This still sometimes doesn't work.  - Removed a bunch
	of spurious (not even implemented) functions from   table.h.

2001-12-20 22:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Tiny cleanup of debugging texts.

2001-12-20 22:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_prefs.c: Fixed bug with initialization of cardlists
	toggle button.

2001-12-20 20:26  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, main.c: Set up libggz config code so we
	load/save our preferences from an rc file.

2001-12-20 19:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_prefs.c, game.c, game.h: Added a new preference
	choice: autostart.  If selected, the player need not select "Start
	game" to begin a game.

2001-12-20 19:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, animation.c, cb_main.c, dlg_about.c,
	dlg_prefs.c, dlg_prefs.h, game.c, game.h: Added _very_ rudimentary
	preferences dialog.  Right now, the only thing it can control is
	animations.

2001-12-19 21:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/game.c: Removed useful but still bad sleep(1) from
	end-of-trick handling.

2001-12-19 21:06  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/animation.c: Another fix to the animation process.
	
	On the last step of the animation, we're drawing the card in it's
	final (table) position.  In this case, we don't just draw it
	straight to the window (as we normally do with the animation) but
	must instead draw it on the table buffer ("for real").

2001-12-19 20:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/game.c: Removed worthless/bad "sleep(1)" line that was
	called every time the player made a bad play.

2001-12-19 17:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, game.c, game.h, table.c:
	Changed ANIMATION to a "preference", a globally defined boolean
	value (of course, it's not yet settable after compile-time).  I
	also made another preference, cardlists, that can be set to 0 to
	translate card lists to text messages.
	
	Finally, I fixed a major bug I introduced in the last commit in
	game_alert_hand_size(), and added a comment making this clear.

2001-12-19 17:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, game.c: Added extra debugging messages to
	game functions; plus I did a slight restructuring (improvement) of
	game_handle_max_hand_size.

2001-12-19 17:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acconfig.h, ggzcards/animation.c, ggzcards/animation.h,
	ggzcards/game.c, ggzcards/table.c: Fixed the last know problem with
	animation: the animation graphic wasn't correctly overdrawn when
	the animation was aborted/zipped.
	
	Enabled animation by default.

2001-12-19 04:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, cb_main.c, game.c, game.h,
	table.c: Great fixes to animation code.  It still has a few
	problems, but is now mostly usable.

2001-12-19 03:49  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Fixed bug: when drawing a hand, the code only
	checked the card index to see if it was the currently selected
	card.  Since it didn't check the hand of the card, when you ask for
	a sync each hand is drawn with a selected card.
	
	The fix is easy.

2001-12-19 03:44  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, animation.h, game.c, table.c, table.h: A
	little more restructuring of the table vs game code interface,
	including removing table_play_card.

2001-12-19 03:34  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, game.c, game.h, table.c: A little more
	restructuring of the table vs game code interface.

2001-12-18 17:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, common.c, dlg_main.c,
	dlg_main.h, layout.c, layout.h, main.h, table.c, table.h:
	Miscellaneous code cleanups all over.

2001-12-18 17:33  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, hand.c, hand.h, layout.c, main.c,
	table.c, table.h: Removed unused hand.[ch].

2001-12-18 17:12  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/cb_main.c: Added missing #include.

2001-12-18 17:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, dlg_options.c, game.c, game.h, main.c,
	main.h: Moved more game-client interface code into game.[ch].

2001-12-18 16:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, main.c: Added animation debugging code.

2001-12-18 16:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: animation.c, game.c, table.c: A slight cleanup of
	animation_zip; it can now be called whether or not we're currently
	animating and it'll work things out.

2001-12-18 16:17  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h,
	dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, game.c, game.h, hand.c, hand.h,
	main.c, main.h, table.c, table.h: Did a large cleanup of the gui
	<-> client-common interface.  I moved all of the gui-side interface
	functions into game.[ch], separating them from table and dialog
	code.

2001-12-18 14:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, animation.c, animation.h, dlg_main.c,
	game.c, game.h, main.c, table.c, table.h: Moved animation code into
	a separate file.

2001-12-18 01:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.c, game.h, layout.c,
	layout.h, main.c, table.c, table.h: Updated animation code.  Now it
	almost works - but it's still disabled.
	
	Uncomment the #definition of ANIMATION in game.h to use it.

2001-12-17 22:06  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Moved internal (static) data into its own
	struct.

2001-12-17 04:11  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, autogen.sh, configure.in, chess/game.c, chess/main.c,
	chess/net.c, chinese-checkers/game.c, chinese-checkers/main.c,
	combat/main.c, dots/main.c, ggzcards/common.c, ggzcards/common.h,
	hastings/main.c, lapocha/main.c, reversi/main.c,
	spades/client_func.c, tictactoe/main.c: Changed gtk-games autoconf
	process to use acinclude.ggz, and updated all the code to use the
	newly renamed ggzmod functions.

2001-12-17 02:13  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* acinclude.ggz: Updated acinclude.ggz to check for new ggzmod;
	added it to gtk-games and gtk-client.

2001-12-16 21:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Cleaned up message dialog creation code, and
	fixed the spacing on it.

2001-12-16 21:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_about.c: Actually fixed the spacing - for real, this
	time - of the "about" dialog.

2001-12-16 19:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_about.c: Cleaned up the about dialog a bit more, and
	fixed the spacing of the top vbox.

2001-12-16 19:50  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: board.c, game.c: - ensure strcmp etc. is defined

2001-12-16 19:47  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/ggzintl.c: - fix i18n function

2001-12-16 19:44  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: main.c, table.c: - gcc3 compat: define strcmp and abs -
	cast array index to int (this may be questionable, but it would be
	a warning   otherwise... I'll check this)

2001-12-16 19:38  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: gtk_connect.c, gtk_dlg_error.c, gtk_dlg_options.c,
	gtk_io.c, gtk_play.c: - include string.h for strcmp - comment out
	all unused variables; however, if they're not really useful they  
	should be erased

2001-12-16 18:59  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_about.c, dlg_about.h: Updated about-dialog
	creation code.	I also updated the listed version to 0.0.5pre.

2001-12-15 14:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/ggzcards.diff: An experimental patch that converts the La
	Pocha client to use the ggzcards server and protocol.
	
	To use it, apply the patch and copy over common.[ch] and
	protocol.[ch] from gtk-games/ggzcards.
	
	Again, this is just an experiment, and done mostly to test the
	robustness of the ggzcards client common libraries.  It will crash
	every now and then, for reasons unknown.

2001-12-13 09:53  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_about.c, main.c: Changed "OK" to "Close" in the
	dialog windows.

2001-12-13 08:39  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Changed table_alert_player so we don't get
	spurious notifications of a player joining the game.

2001-12-13 08:26  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Now debugging logs go to a file,
	~/.ggz/ggzcards-gtk.debug.  Also I cleaned up main() a little bit.

2001-12-11 01:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/game.c, chess/game.h, chess/net.c, chinese-checkers/game.h,
	chinese-checkers/main.c, dots/game.h, hastings/game.h,
	lapocha/game.h, tictactoe/game.h: Remove all unnecessary
	#definitions of GGZ_SEAT_OPEN, and instead #include <ggz_client.h>
	where necessary.

2001-12-11 00:23  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, main.c, main.h: Changed
	GGZdModSeat to GGZSeatType.

2001-12-11 00:15  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h,
	main.c, main.h: Several cleanups to the core system:   - Changed
	the hand structure to a straight typedef.    - Reverted the buggy
	realloc call in increase_max_hand_size, so that it	now just
	malloc's every time (leaking memory, but without a crash).    -
	Changed table_get_options to return an int.  Returning a negative  
	   value will allow the default options to be used.  (Perhaps this
	should	    be a true-false system instead.)	- Added
	table_alert_newgame function, to alert the table (frontend) when   
	  we receive a newgame message (newgame actually starting) from the
	     server.

2001-12-10 18:05  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, table.c, table.h: Changed two
	function names (of table callback functions).

2001-12-10 17:34  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: If the server sends us any hand before we've
	set up the table, we just ignore it.  This prevents the ugly
	drawing of empty hands over the splash screen when playing
	multiplayer.

2001-12-10 17:03  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, game.h, main.c, main.h: Changed
	table_alert_player_name(player, name) to
	player_alert_player(player, status, name).  It now sends the GGZ
	seat status of the seat.  The table frontend uses this information
	to give helpful joining/leaving messages.

2001-12-10 16:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, layout.c, main.c, table.c: Renamed
	global "game" variable to ggzcards.

2001-12-10 14:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, main.c, main.h, module.dsc.in,
	protocol.h: Restructured the message system of the protocol.  I
	also took this opportunity to add a lot of comments to protocol.h.

2001-12-10 11:17  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, dlg_bid.c, layout.h, table.c, table.h:
	Inserted a hack to redraw the table each time we get a bid request.
	 This more-or-less works around the problems I was seeing before
	where the table wouldn't get drawn properly, and large expanses of
	it would appear blank.
	
	There is some flickering, as clearly the the blank space is still
	being drawn (and then immediately overwritten) - I really need to
	track down this bug.

2001-12-10 11:03  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Cleaned up table_setup().

2001-12-10 11:02  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Cleaned up handle_msg_hand.

2001-12-10 01:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Two changes:   - Fix the cardlist dialog so it
	will dynamically resize if a different-     sized cardlist is sent.
	 This is currently only needed for La Pocha.	- Fix the gameover
	message so that it will not be immediately	overwritten by the
	newgame request message, and fix its grammaer.

2001-12-10 01:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Fixed small memory leak.

2001-12-10 00:34  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_options.c: Fixed typo in earlier commit.

2001-12-09 23:46  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h, dlg_options.c, main.c: More
	separation of bid and options code.

2001-12-09 23:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h: Oops.  Added files
	missing from last commit.

2001-12-09 22:57  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h: Fixed up the bid
	and options dialogs.  They'll now be appropriately destroyed when a
	new bid/option request comes in, or the user makes their
	bid/options choice.

2001-12-09 22:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Allowed a new option request to override the
	old one, rather than barfing on it.

2001-12-09 22:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, main.c, table.c: Allowed a bid request to
	override a previous bid request.  I also fixed up several other
	minor problems (like a missing free()), and added some more
	debugging messages.

2001-12-09 21:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Added some comments, particularly on the
	memory-management situation.

2001-12-09 20:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c, game.c,
	layout.c, main.c, table.c: Changed things around so ggzcards-client
	now uses libggz for memory management and debugging.

2001-12-09 18:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_main.c, main.c, main.h: When
	a newgame request is received, the client no longer automatically
	sends the response.  Instead, you must choose "Start Game" from the
	game menu for the reponse to be sent.

2001-12-09 17:23  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_main.c, main.c: Removed "edit" menu; moved
	"preferences" under "game" menu.

2001-11-13 16:58  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.h, main.c, protocol.h,
	table.c: Removed deprecated WH_ prefixes.

2001-11-13 16:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c,
	dlg_main.c: Added "sync" menu item.

2001-11-08 15:20  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: Fixed bug: we no longer allow the bid or
	options dialogs to be destroyed.

2001-11-08 14:52  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: main.c, table.c: Clear pixmap before drawing cards on
	it for cardlist canvas.

2001-11-08 04:09  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_about.c, dlg_about.h,
	dlg_main.c, dlg_main.h, layout.c, main.c, protocol.c, support.c,
	support.h, table.c: Added names by card lists.
	
	The card list is out of order.	It's probably sent that way by the
	server.

2001-11-08 03:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: main.c, main.h, table.c, table.h: Cardlist messages
	now show the cards graphically.
	
	There are some probems with this - there are no names shown with
	the cardlist (as there should be), and I think the ordering is
	wrong.	I'll fix these later.

2001-11-08 02:25  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Corrected dialog window use.

2001-11-07 19:05  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Translate card list information to text
	on-the-fly.
	
	Eventually this will be replaced by graphics for the cards.

2001-10-28 21:39  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Fix small problems with previous commit.

2001-10-28 21:36  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Experimental code: make a text message out of
	the cardlist message.

2001-10-28 03:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, protocol.h, table.c, table.h:
	Added client-side stuff to handle cardlist messages.
	
	Although these are not shown in the GUI yet, the core
	infrastructure is in place for them.

2001-10-28 01:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, module.dsc.in, protocol.h: I've had enough
	of the fixed messaging system.	Although incredibly flexible, it's
	very limiting in terms of user interface issues.
	
	So, I changed the protocol to allow different types of global
	messages to be passed to the client.
	
	Each message is still identified by a "mark" that is a single
	string.  In the simplest case, the client can (and currently does)
	use this mark just as the name of the message (for instance for the
	items on the "Messages" menu).	In more complicated cases, the
	client may use this as an index into its own system (ultimately
	this may be a reason for switching over to an XML-style protocol,
	but that's a question for another day).
	
	However, there are now different "types" of global messages.  The
	simplest one is a "TEXT" message that is the same as the messaging
	system used now: a single string, intended to be displayed as-is in
	a fixed-width font by the client.  A second type of message is the
	"CARD GROUP" message, which consists of a group of cards (one card
	per player).  A third is the "CARD LIST" message, which consists of
	a list of cards (n cards per player).  (The card list message could
	be viewed as a superset of the card group message, but since the
	display for the two is generally quite different I've kept it like
	this for now.)	A final one is the "BLOCK" message, which includes
	game-specific information that may or may not be used by the client
	(in a format to be determined later).
	
	For compatibility, I also bumped the protocol version number up.
	
	It should be remembered that this is an experimental system; I'm
	really going to have to see how things shake out as I go along. 
	The card group and card list systems should be good enough to start
	with, once I put together some code to use them.  After that, I'll
	see how things fall together for the game-specific system.

2001-10-08 18:09  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, hand.c, hand.h, layout.h, table.c:
	Fixed table_verify_hand_size(), which was really ugly.	Now there's
	a table_alert_hand_size(max_hand_size) instead.  This alerts the
	table to the maximum hand size.
	
	The table may then wish to increase this value so as to for
	everything to fit (as the GTK client does).

2001-10-08 14:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: Replaced explicit casts from ints to
	gpointers with GPOINTER_TO_INT and GINT_TO_POINTER.  Changed int's
	to be gints.

2001-09-14 02:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.h, main.c, table.c, table.h: Cleaned up table
	code.

2001-09-08 21:54  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h: Changed misnamed value "seat" in
	the seat structure to "assign".  I also made note that it is not
	used (although it is communicated as part of the comm protocol).

2001-09-08 21:44  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, module.dsc.in, protocol.c, protocol.h: Made
	correction read_seat -> es_read_int.

2001-09-08 21:02  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/module.dsc.in: Corrected protocol version information.

2001-09-08 19:06  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, protocol.c, protocol.h: Updated to newer
	version of protocol-common code, and changed function names to use
	this new interface.

2001-09-08 18:21  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, protocol.c, protocol.h: Updated protocol.*
	files from the server, and updated the client-common code to use
	the new interfaces.

2001-09-08 14:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Fixed incorrect assertion.

2001-09-07 04:55  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, common.c, common.h, protocol.c,
	protocol.h: Added protocol.c with new common server-client code,
	removed similar code from common.[ch], and updated Makefile.am to
	reflect the new file.

2001-09-07 03:43  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Removed unnecessary (I think) sleep(1) call upon
	starting a new game.

2001-09-07 03:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, game.h, layout.c, main.c, table.c: Moved two
	more game_*** functions into game.[ch].

2001-09-07 03:25  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, game.h, main.c, table.c: Removed unneeded
	(nearly worthless, in fact) ggz_snprintf() function.  I fixed one
	set of code to correctly work without having this wrapper for
	snprintf.

2001-09-07 02:55  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, cb_bid.c, cb_bid.h, dlg_bid.c: Removed
	unused cb_bid.[ch] files.

2001-09-05 21:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: Use g_malloc and g_free in GUI code instead
	of malloc and free.

2001-09-05 21:26  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_bid.h, game.h, layout.h, main.h, table.h: Removed
	rediculous extern declarations.

2001-09-05 18:52  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c: Fixed the worst code
	ever.
	
	The behavior should be identical, but instead of leaving around a
	pointer to be freed at some distant location we free it immediately
	after using it.  It's now up to the function being called to copy
	that data if necessary.

2001-09-05 17:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Reviewed all code, cleaned up a lot of it and
	fixed a few small bugs.

2001-09-05 16:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/protocol.h: Updated client's version of the protocol
	header file (copied from the server code).

2001-08-28 01:34  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Updated ggzmod check to look for ggz_connect
	instead of ggz_client_connect.

2001-08-25 15:13  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/main.c, chinese-checkers/game.c, chinese-checkers/main.c,
	combat/main.c, dots/main.c, ggzcards/common.c, hastings/main.c,
	lapocha/main.c, reversi/main.c, spades/client_func.c,
	tictactoe/main.c: Switched games to using ggz_*** naming
	convention, and added ggz_disconnect() calls for all games.

2001-08-25 10:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/Makefile.am, chinese-checkers/game.c,
	chinese-checkers/ggz.c, chinese-checkers/ggz.h,
	chinese-checkers/main.c, combat/main.c, dots/main.c,
	hastings/game.h, hastings/main.c, lapocha/main.c, reversi/game.h,
	reversi/main.c, spades/client_func.c, tictactoe/game.h,
	tictactoe/main.c: Switched over all remaining gtk-games to use
	libggzmod.
	
	This was so easy I figured I'd go ahead and just do it.  I haven't
	tested any of them, but they didn't work before so there's no loss.

2001-08-23 21:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: Makefile.am, ggz.c, ggz.h, main.c: Update Chess to use
	GGZMod, removing old GGZ files and changing function calls to match
	the current GGZMod standard.

2001-08-23 17:19  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c, lapocha/main.c, spades/client_func.c: Updated
	gtk-games to use the new libggzmod.

2001-08-23 16:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/client_func.c: "Fixed up" spades to work with libggzdmod.
	
	It doesn't *really* use libggzdmod, it just uses ggz_client_connect
	to get the socket FD.  Obviously a lot more cleanup is possible.

2001-08-20 03:45  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/main.c: Upgraded La Pocha GTK client to use libggzmod.

2001-07-23 19:30  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.h: Added significantly to doxygen documentation. 
	See http://devon.dhs.org/ggz/doxygen/ggzcards/.

2001-07-23 19:01  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Slight cleanup in common.c.

2001-07-23 18:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, main.c: Set game.state to WH_STATE_INIT in
	client_initialize (client common code) rather than game_init
	(frontend code).

2001-07-23 18:38  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.h: Added a little bit to doxygen documentation.

2001-07-23 08:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h: Added client_send_sync_request
	function, and used it in the case of a bad match on a play message
	(along with a brilliant comment on why it's necessary).

2001-07-23 08:01  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, dlg_bid.c, game.c, game.h: Fixed problem
	with multiply freeing options data (oops!).  Also cleaned up that
	code a little bit.

2001-07-23 06:35  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_about.c, dlg_bid.c, dlg_main.c, table.c: Added _(
	) markers around more translatable strings.  I think I got them
	all, but there still aren't very many since most are created by the
	server.

2001-07-23 03:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, table.c: Removed selected_card
	field from seat_t structure, since this data is frontend-specific. 
	Added static selected_card variable to table.c; now there's just
	one variable instead of one per player.

2001-07-23 03:20  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.h, table.c: Removed unused message field of
	seat_t structure.  (How long has it gone unused, I wonder?)

2001-07-23 03:13  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h: Removed length restriction from
	player names.

2001-07-23 03:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.h: Cleaned up/added to doxygen documentation.

2001-07-23 02:56  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/common.c: Cleaned things up a tiny bit by replacing
	struct seat_t with seat_t.

2001-07-23 02:47  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h, game.c,
	game.h, hand.c, hand.h, main.c, table.c: Practically finished
	client-common pseudo-library.
	
	It's not really a library, just three separate files: common.[ch]
	and protocol.h.  The rest of code works off of this pseudo-library
	through a system of function calls and callbacks.  The interface to
	the library (in common.h) is documented using doxygen; see
	http://devon.dhs.org/ggz/doxygen/.
	
	I really don't know how to effectively split this code off into a
	real library so that multiple clients can use it.  It should go
	into a ggz module, but none fits.  Should a ggz-game-libs module be
	created?  Would this be of use to other games?	The way it is now,
	updating it would be a mess with multiple client frontends, and the
	code itself is just a big jumble of functions in common.c.  I could
	partially split it off by placing it in a separate directory within
	ggzcards, but this is an irrevocable step (using CVS) so I won't do
	that just yet.
	
	TODO: After reviewing this code, there are several points in it
	that need to be updated/expanded on/cleaned up.  I don't remember
	where they all are right now, but when I read this later I'll
	probably remember most of them.

2001-07-22 19:38  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, main.c, main.h, table.c, table.h:
	Added more code to the common pseudo-library: the messaging code. 
	Also added some additional comments to the library interface.

2001-07-22 19:07  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/docs.html: Removed docs.html file - this contained
	instructions for La Pocha, which is no longer appropriate.

2001-07-22 19:03  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_bid.c, cb_bid.h, cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_about.c,
	dlg_about.h, dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h, dlg_main.c, dlg_main.h, game.c,
	game.h, hand.c, hand.h, layout.c, layout.h, main.c, main.h,
	protocol.h, table.c, table.h: Added $Id: ChangeLog 3965 2002-04-13 06:29:00Z bmh $ headers to all (well,
	almost all) files.
	
	Note that the commit will in itself will make the last-modified
	dates of all the files useless to begin with.

2001-07-22 18:41  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h: Test of CVS (RCS) keyword
	substitution for $Id: ChangeLog 3965 2002-04-13 06:29:00Z bmh $.

2001-07-22 18:38  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: common.c, common.h, dlg_bid.c, game.c, game.h, hand.c,
	layout.c, main.c, table.c: Expanded "common" code slightly, moving
	ggz_debug to it and removing game.fd in favor of ggzfd.

2001-07-22 18:09  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, common.c, common.h, main.c: Created the
	rudimentary beginnings of a common client library in common.[ch].

2001-07-19 15:08  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/Makefile.am: Fixed cards-*.xpm entries in Makefile.am.

2001-07-18 20:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Cleaned up code; removing some extra
	commented-out code.

2001-07-18 19:43  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Set up GGZCards to use libggzmod.
	
	This was quite easy:	- Removed the old ggz_connect code.	-
	Instead of calling ggz_connect, call ggz_client_init and       
	ggz_client_connect.   - Call ggz_client_quit before exit (not
	totally necessary).
	
	All the rest should be taken care of by autoconf.

2001-07-18 18:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Added check for ggzmod library/header files, and
	added -lggzmod to link with the library.

2001-07-18 16:18  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Inserted manditory 1-second pause at the end of
	a trick before clearing the cards.  Ideally, this would be made an
	option.

2001-07-16 23:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Added separate check for easysock library/header
	file to configure.in.
	
	Previously, the check was just a part of the ggzcore library check,
	so if easysock wasn't present the error would be "Cannot find
	ggzcore library".

2001-07-14 15:04  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/module.dsc.in, chinese-checkers/module.dsc.in,

2001-07-13 22:59  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in, chess/Makefile.am, chess/module.dsc.in,

	- Bumped version to 0.0.5pre - Use new ggz-config syntax
	(--fromfile -> --modfile) - New .dsc file format (Protocol ->
	ProtocolEngine, ProtocolVersion)

2001-07-11 15:36  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/hand.c: Changed variable names in hand_read_hand() so
	that there's no identifier shadowing.

2001-07-10 22:31  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/hand.c: "Fixed" the bug that was causing the La Pocha
	clients to crash.  This was caused by a seg fault in the client
	when, on the _second_ time that the client had to increase it's
	hand size, free() was called to destroy the old hand.
	
	Calling free() here wasn't a good idea to begin with - it should be
	realloc, since it's possible that we need to save some of the hand
	data.
	
	However, I have no clue why free() would fail on what seems to be a
	perfectly normal g_malloc'd pointer.  To fix it, I have simply
	removed the free() call - creating a memory leak.

2001-07-10 15:16  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_about.c: Updated credits section ("About" dialog
	window): removed Windows client and added Game Modules/AI Modules.

2001-07-08 15:29  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: main.c, table.c, table.h: As jzaun suggested, I
	switched some of the text to be a fixed-width font so that the
	server can do more formatting of the data (using whitespace).
	
	I really didn't know what I was doing, so the result may be less
	than ideal.  However, I think it's a step forward.  Currently only
	the message windows use the fixed-width font, but ultimately all
	messages should probably do so.

2001-07-08 03:00  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Inserted checks on labels being NULL to avoid
	having GTK complain about failed assertions.
	
	The problem is that the server sends text messages (player names,
	player messages, etc) as soon as they become available, but the
	client does not set up the table until it first receives a hand (at
	which time it first has an idea of what size the table should be). 
	Thus, before the first hand is sent any messages will be worthless
	_as far as the graphics go_.  However, these messages are saved and
	used when the table is set up, so there shouldn't be any problem
	with the current system other than its lack of elegance.
	
	An alternative would be to setup the table earlier, most likely as
	soon as the client finds out how many players there are.  However,
	we'd have to guess at the hand size and end up having to re-setup
	and re-size the table later when the hand is sent.  This would be
	ugly for the user; it's cleaner just to leave the splash screen up
	the whole time.
	
	The only real drawback of the current system in this regard is if
	the hand size changes.	The client remembers the "maximum hand
	size", which it uses for sizing the table.  When the first hand is
	received, the max hand size is set and the table is setup.  If a
	larger hand then follows, the table will be set up again, most
	likely with a resize at the same time.	There might even be strange
	games where we'd want to resize the window to be smaller, not
	leaving it at the _maximum_ hand size but basing it upon recent
	hand sizes.  Making these possible would require additions to the
	protocol which I do not consider worthwhile, so are likely to
	remain as they are.

2001-07-07 02:53  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Fixed another buglet: another duplicate
	#define.

2001-07-07 02:51  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: hand.h, main.c: Fixed two buglets: a missing return
	statement, and a duplicated #define.

2001-07-07 02:51  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/dlg_bid.c: Replaced remaining uses of es_read_string
	with es_read_string_alloc.  Really, we don't know how long these
	strings can be, so this is the best way to go.

2001-07-07 01:10  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Changed several es_read_string's to
	es_read_string_alloc's, making buffer overflow (resulting in lost
	characters that screw us later on) far less likely.

2001-06-27 14:42  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: A slightly cleaner implementation of the message
	windows.

2001-06-27 14:34  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: There's that pesky bug\!  es_read_string fails
	catastrophically when the string is longer than the buffer given. 
	es_read_string_alloc does the trick.  I'll have to fix this in
	several other places as well.

2001-06-27 00:52  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/main.c: Slightly improved message window implementation
	- autoupdating of windows, and left justification of text.

2001-06-27 00:13  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_main.c, main.c, main.h, table.c: Initial
	implementation of a generalized message window system.	Wow, this
	is going to be cool.

2001-06-26 15:57  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: dlg_main.c, hand.c, layout.c, layout.h, main.c,
	main.h, table.c: Changed table layout routines: global message goes
	in statusbar at the bottom; max hand size is made no larger than
	necessary for cards to fit on the table.

2001-06-26 14:43  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/.cvsignore: Added kdevelop project file to unincluded
	file list.

2001-06-26 14:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, game.h: Changed client state to be
	enumeration.

2001-06-26 14:28  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: Makefile.am, game.h, protocol.h: Moved communication
	protocol data into separate file protocol.h.

2001-06-26 13:50  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_bid.c, cb_bid.h: Commented out unneeded code.

2001-06-26 13:44  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: cb_bid.c, cb_main.c, dlg_about.c, dlg_bid.c,
	dlg_main.c, main.c: Removed seemingly unneeded support.h
	dependancies.

2001-06-25 16:28  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: layout.c, layout.h, table.c: Initial implementation
	allowing 5 or 6 players.

2001-06-25 15:57  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: hand.c, main.c, table.c: Client doesn't assume
	anything about the size of the hand; it resizes the window when it
	gets a too-large hand.

2001-06-25 14:40  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Added blank background for splash screen.

2001-06-25 14:32  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.h, hand.c, hand.h, layout.h, main.c: Changed
	MAX_HAND_SIZE to game.max_hand_size.

2001-06-25 14:22  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/layout.c: Restructured layout setup, using pointers to
	functions instead of fixed data.

2001-06-25 14:08  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.c, layout.c, main.c: Added lots of assertions.

	* ggzcards/: dlg_main.c, layout.c, layout.h, main.c, table.c,
	table.h: Changed table initialization so we wait until we know the
	number of players to set it up.

2001-06-22 02:27  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/table.c: Removed c++ style comments.

	when you receive validation of the play from the server.

2001-06-20 03:08  Jason Short <jdorje@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ggzcards/: game.h, main.c, table.c: Implemented playing from

	It's based on the La Pocha code, but was heavily modified before
	being imported.

2001-06-17 21:46  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	reversi/Makefile.am: - All calls to ggz-config should use the '-D'
	option - ggz-config now uses -D to make it build the config file in
	$DESTDIR

2001-03-13 23:16  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/pixmaps/Makefile.am: - This change will make RPM

	ccheckers.dsc - changed section id to [ModuleInfo] and added Name=
	param

	* hastings/Makefile.in, reversi/main_win.c:

2001-03-04 17:11  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chinese-checkers/: game.h, main.c: - Added support to client for
	leave/rejoin - Client requests resync on move requests during
	invalid server state - Client dies on most invalid moves - ones
	indicating a broken client - Player name display now issues
	leave/rejoin statusbar messages

2001-03-03 11:41  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/libcgc/movecheck.c: Improve handling of checking to see if
	we're entering check.

2001-02-20 12:03  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: board.c, board.h, chess.h, game.c, game.h, main_win.c,
	net.c, net.h, glade/ggz.chess.glade: 
	- Disabled the styles on the info box for now, so the "No names"
	bug should be gone. (as I couldn't reproduce it, I think this is
	the best solution by now) - Client clock now works - Added a menu
	to request a time update from the server (useful for Server clock)
	- When using client clock, every 15 seconds send a MSG_UPDATE to
	the server, telling that in the last 15 seconds he hasn't done
	anything. (to avoid player that are out of time just refusing to
	move, and so don't telling the server that they are out of time)

2001-02-19 17:21  bugg

	* chess/libcgc/: movecheck.c, movecheck.h: Fix the bugs that were
	reported to me by jzaun Namely, interposition code, en passant

	oponent has run out of time - The info box (on the top right)
	cronometer works ok

	* chess/: board.c, board.h, callbacks.c, game.c, net.c, net.h,
	popup.c, popup.h, glade/popup_dialogs.glade: 
	- Promoting of pieces now work - The protocol had to be changed, so
	this version is not backwards compatible   with the previous one

2001-02-19 07:36  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: board.c, board.h, game.c, main_win.c,
	glade/ggz.chess.glade: 
	- Changed the last_moves column from a GtkList to a GtkText - Show
	the last moves on screen (using cgc's notation for now, useful for 
	 debugging)

2001-02-18 17:35  bugg

	* chess/libcgc/movecheck.c: I'm an idiot.  My brain has fried from
	cgc.  Fix the bug introduced in previous commit.

2001-02-18 17:21  bugg

	commit.

2001-02-18 17:20  bugg

2001-02-18 16:43  bugg

	* chess/libcgc/movecheck.c: Fix (haha, Fix- more like try to fix) a
	bug that caused mates in which there was a piece that would have
	been able to interpose if it wasn't pinned to be recognised as
	checks.
	
	I haven't tested this with the game that broke it, but the patch
	has passed regression testing- and everyone (jzaun, perdig) wants
	me to commit in the form that it is.

2001-02-18 16:24  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/game.h:

	glade/ggz.chess.glade: 
	- Fixed bug when displaying time option (was displaying a weird
	number instead of 0) - Players names show up in the main window
	(instead of "White" and "Black") - Player's labels are painted with
	different colors (black for the black player, a gray for white ->
	pure white was impossible to read) - Draw a small arrow besides the
	player's name to show the current turn

2001-02-17 10:28  bugg

	* chess/libcgc/: board.c, cgc.c, cgc.h, games.c, movecheck.c,
	movecheck.h: Sync libcgc to fischer's version.	Hopefully this
	won't break anything ^^; (should be no API changes)

	main_win.c, net.c, net.h, popup.c, popup.h, glade/ggz.chess.glade,
	glade/popup_dialogs.glade: 
	- Receiving a REQ_DRAW from the server popups a dialog asking if
	you want to   draw the game - Added a "Request draw" submenu that
	will request the server for a draw

2001-02-11 19:12  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: board.c, board.h, callbacks.c, chess.h, game.c, net.c: 
	- When moving a piece, highlight the place where it currently is
	and the place	where it is over, if it's a valid move. (ie, you
	can easily know if your move   is valid) - Check for validity of a
	move before sending it (to avoid unecessary traffic) - Don't allow
	the user to drag his opponents pieces (duh!) - Tells the user if
	his opponent is in check, or highlight his own king if he   is on
	check

2001-02-11 09:34  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: game.c, game.h: 
	- Added some status bar messages for user feedback

2001-02-10 20:57  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/: game.c, net.c, net.h: 
	- Dragging and dropping a piece now sends the move to the server -
	Receives a MSG_MOVE and update the board - Handles MSG_GAMEOVER -
	In short, the game is now playable!

2001-02-10 10:06  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* chess/callbacks.c: 
	- Fixed a bug with the drag drop

	- Handles MSG_PLAYERS (Get the players names) - Handles REQ_TIME
	(answer with a time option 0, ie, no clock, for now) - Handles
	MNS_START (to start the game) - Drag and drop of pieces work
	(nothing is sent to the server yet, though)

	bitmaps/rook_w.xpm: 
	- Changed all images from xbm to xpm (so that I can use
	transparency and keep	the images with two colors). Besides, any
	better looking xpms are welcomed.    (to test them, just overwrite
	the existing ones)  - Draw the pieces on the board (it will draw
	depending on the current board	 state. As we can't move yet, the
	only thing you can see is the initial setup,   but trust me) - Get
	the seat information from the server. Started doing the event
	system

	* combat/: TODO, callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combat.glade, combat.h,
	dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, game.c, game.h, interface.c: 
	- When the user closes or click cancel on the options dialog, it
	will send a   NULL option string to the server (which means that
	this player doesn't want   to set up the options) - The "Show Game
	Options" menu is disable while we don't know the game options -
	Fixed some gtk errors - The preview_options text is now enclosed in
	a scrolled widow widget, instead   of having it's own scrollbar

2000-12-30 18:53  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: TODO, combat.c, combat.h, dlg_options.c, game.c:

	* combat/: combat.c, combat.h, dlg_options.c, game.c,

	* combat/: TODO, callbacks.c, combat.c, combat.h, dlg_options.c,
	dlg_options.h, game.c, map.c, map.h: 
	- Added a ARMY(OPTIONS, TYPE) macro to combat.h to avoid the need
	to type   OPTIONS->ARMY[OPTIONS->NUMBER][TYPE]. It is used to get
	the default number of	units of this type for this map - Fixed a
	lot of bugs   - No more GTK error messages   - No more "Your client

	* combat/: TODO, combat.c, combat.h, dlg_options.c, game.c: 
	- All the options checking stuff is in the combat_options_check
	function in   combat.[ch] - combat_options_string_read now makes a
	copy of the options string passed, so	that it can be used after
	the call - Uses the combat_options_check function to check if it
	should send the current   options to the server. If it can't, tells
	the user what has gone wrong (and   doesn't erase the map)

2000-12-23 07:49  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: TODO, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, game.c:

2000-12-23 06:53  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: TODO, dlg_options.c: - Fixed memory leak on the map

	* combat/: TODO, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h: 
	- Map editor now shows a preview of the selected map

2000-12-21 07:31  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: TODO, dlg_options.c, game.c: 
	- Name of the map is now sent over to the other player, so that he
	can have an   idea of how to name it when saving it.	- This only
	works if the host player has given a name for the map, ie, if	  
	this map was loaded from a file or if the player has saved it after
	     designing it.

2000-12-20 09:16  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: TODO, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h: 
	- Added more information to the map editor (how many of each tile
	type, the   total of units used until now), to make it easier to
	create a map

2000-12-19 18:14  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: TODO, callbacks.c, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, game.c,
	gtk_player_info.c, main.c: 
	- Made the map editor use the combat_game struct to store the game
	information,   instead of a different format (as it was supposed to
	be since the beggining) - Added a "Save" button to the map editor
	(no more need to start a game in   order to save a map)

2000-12-19 16:38  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/TODO: 
	- Added a TODO file

2000-12-18 18:46  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/map.c: 
	- Fixed bug when saving map (was using the army of the player 0,
	not of the -   dummy - player 2.)

2000-12-17 14:40  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h, game.c, interface.c: 
	- Added a "Save current map" menu item, so that you don't have to
	play a map   until the end to save it

2000-12-15 20:12  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h: 
	- You can now delete a map from the list (and it will delete the
	file as well,	as long as you have user permissions to do that) -
	Display a (ugly) confirmation dialog before removing the file

2000-12-15 15:51  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: Makefile.am, confio.c, dlg_options.c, game.c, game.h,
	map.c, map.h, maps/Checkers.4227780237, maps/Makefile.am: 
	- Added a new map - "make install" install the maps on
	$ggzexecdir/combat/maps, usually   /usr/local/lib/ggz/combat/maps -
	The games now reads your maps from the $ggzexecdir/combat/maps and 
	 $home/.ggz/combat/maps - When saving a map, it will try to save it
	under $ggzexecdir/combat/maps. If   it doesn't have enough
	permissions, it will save it under   $home/.ggz/combat/maps
	(creating the directory if that's the case) - All map related
	functions are now done in the map.c file

2000-12-10 06:49  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	maps/Default, maps/Default.127898, maps/Island I.1321921533: 
	- Made the names of the maps display fine in the maps list (Only
	the map name,	not it's name + hash) - Selecting a map in the maps
	list does a quick load on it (will be used later,   when we have
	previewing of the maps working) - As the map is being loaded
	anyway, generate his hash and check if it matches   the one in the
	filename. If it doesn't (the map was manually edited or his  
	filename doesn't have the hash), rename the file to the correct
	name.  - Changed the name of the Default and the 8x8 map to have
	the hash as well - Added map from last game w/ Justin

2000-12-09 15:28  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: combat.c, combat.h, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h,
	game.c, game.h: 
	- Changed the API in combat.[ch] - Added the number of players to
	the combat_game structure - Implemented saving of maps. (when the
	game is over, it will search your   maps directories and will see
	if you have a map whose hash matches the   current one. If you
	haven't, it will ask you to save it)

2000-12-09 12:51  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/dlg_options.c: 
	- Fixed a segfault when couldn't find any map

2000-12-09 10:34  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, maps/8x8, maps/Default,
	maps/default: 
	- Renamed the "default" map to "Default" - Added another map (The
	'chessboard' one from  
	http://www.inficad.com/~ecollins/stratego/stratego-rule-variations.
	htm) - Made loading of maps work. Some notes though:   - You must
	run the ggz client from the combat source directory, or it won't   
	 find your maps (it will search for them in the ./maps dir)   - You
	can't save a map yet, so you will have to write it by hand

2000-12-09 09:08  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: Makefile.am, confio.c, confio.h, dlg_options.c,
	dlg_options.h, game.c, lists.c, lists.h, maps/default: 
	- Added confio.[ch] and lists.[ch] files - Added a default map (not
	being loaded yet) - The map lists loads *all* the visible files on
	the "./maps" subdir - Clicking on the "Load" button returns the
	correct filename of the selected   file. (That will be different
	from what is showed on the maps list) - Added Rich's ROL algorithm
	to calculate the Hash of a map (not being used	 yet)
	
	TODO:
	
	- Load the map from the file (this weekend it will be working, I
	guess)

2000-12-09 08:59  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/confio.c: 
	- Fixed bug in confio_write_list (the same one that was in
	ggzcore's confio.c)

2000-12-08 18:38  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: combat.c, combat.h, game.c, game.h: 
	- Modified protocol to include game options (details in combat.h) -
	Added O_NAME option (Map name) - Tells the user when can't
	recognize the options sent by the server - Removed some unecessary
	code

2000-12-08 17:20  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, glade/dlg_options.glade: 
	- Added Justin`s Load/Save Maps dialog

2000-12-05 12:12  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: Makefile.am, about_dlg.c, about_dlg.h, main_win.c,
	options_dlg.c: 
	- Made the background pixmap buttons and labels non sensitive
	(won't implement   it until I get some nice background images) -
	Added an about dialog

2000-12-04 13:26  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: confio.c, confio.h, main_win.c: 
	- changed game's _ggzcore_confio_parse and file_parser to accept a
	autocreate   argument - made the game autocreate a config file if
	it doesn't exist (call	 _ggzcore_confio_parse w/ autocreate = 1)
	
	  This fixes all the bugs that were happening with the config files
	not being
	  found or not able to be writen on

2000-12-03 14:46  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: Makefile.am, confio.c, confio.h, lists.c, lists.h,
	main.c, main_win.c, options_dlg.c, options_dlg.h: 
	- Created a options dialog, with the background color, last played
	color and   background pixmap - Implemented changing of background
	color and last played color - Saves this options to
	~/.ggz/reversi-gtk.rc
	
	Knows bugs:   - If this file doesn't exist, it won't save the
	options the first time the     game is run, but only on the
	following   - As _ggzcore_confio_parse was returning -1 when the
	file didn't existed, it     was never saving anything. So I removed
	that check, but some other stuff     may be broken because of that.
	(probably the first bug is because of it     also)... not the best
	solution, but it worked by now... later I'll see the	 best way
	of fixing that. (should I create the file first, and then call	  
	confio_parse?)

2000-12-03 14:39  Justin Zaun <jzaun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, hastings/Makefile, hastings/Makefile.in: 
	- Added Hastings to configure

2000-11-23 14:44  Josef Spillner <dr_maux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hastings/: Makefile, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, dlg_about.c,
	dlg_about.h, frame_ll.xpm, frame_lr.xpm, frame_ul.xpm,
	frame_ur.xpm, game.h, hastings.dsc, main.c, main_win.c, main_win.h,
	map.xpm, newmanblue.xpm, newmangreen.xpm, newmanred.xpm,
	newmanyellow.xpm, support.c, support.h: -initial CVS import
	-nothing has changed since the last tests...

2000-11-12 14:44  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: dlg_options.c, game.h: - Fixed bug with big maps (some
	variables were chars instead of ints), which  made some units
	impossible to move - Fixed bug on edit map dialog (made clicking on
	the right spot a bit	    difficult)

2000-11-10 19:00  Justin Zaun <jzaun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/glade/dlg_options.glade: 
	- Some changes to the option dialog

2000-11-10 18:45  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/glade/dlg_options.glade: 
	- Aded glade files

2000-11-10 17:13  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, combat.dsc, dlg_options.c, game.c: 
	- Implemented setup of the number of initial units - Fixed bug when
	using a map bigger then 10x10 (the main board now resizes   nicely)
	- You can set up almost any initial army, and almost any initial
	map, making    for virtually ilimited ways of playing the game

2000-11-09 18:16  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: Makefile.am, dlg_options.c, dlg_options.h, game.c,
	game.h: 
	- Added options dialog, to set up a starting game. Currently works:
	    - Set up the initial map - Known bugs:  - As you can't
	currently set up the initial army, you must use 40 starting	   
	     positions for each player, or the server won't accept your
	setup.	     - It may work with more than 40 starting positions,
	but I haven't tested it 	    yet     - It won't work with
	maps bigger than 10x10 (the options dialog handles it		  
	nicely, but the client won't resize its board)		- It may
	work with maps smaller then that... hadn't tested it yet  - Todo:  
	   - Add a "Load default" button

2000-10-29 08:45  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: game.c, game.h: 
	- Improved border around last unit (thicker and w/ better color) -
	Added a border around the currently selected unit - Fixed "ghost"
	bug (when drawing a already dead unit)

2000-10-28 12:32  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combat.glade, game.c, game.h,
	interface.c, pixmaps/.cvsignore: 
	- Added a menu item for the "Show/Hide enemy units" option - Only
	shows the enemy unit used on the last move (like on the original
	game) - Draws a little border around the last from and to tiles
	(needs some work, though)

2000-10-28 11:00  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/main.c: 
	- Added the combat source dir to the list of possible pixmaps
	locations	  That means that you don't have to do a "make
	install" to run combat from	   any directory. (as long as you
	don't move the original sources)

2000-10-27 23:10  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/pixmaps/default/: bomb.xpm, captain.xpm, colonel.xpm,
	flag.xpm, general.xpm, lieutenant.xpm, major.xpm, marshall.xpm,
	miner.xpm, scout.xpm, sergeant.xpm, spy.xpm: Renamed tiles with
	pixmaps

2000-10-27 22:48  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/pixmaps/Makefile.am: 
	- Renamed "tiles" to "pixmaps"

2000-10-27 22:33  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: Makefile.am, main.c: 
	- Installs pixmaps file on $(GAMEDIR)/combat/pixmaps (usually  
	/usr/local/lib/ggz) - Added this directory as a pixmap directory   
	    (In short: As long as you've done a "make install", you can run
	ggz from	any dir that combat will find his pixmaps) -
	Besides, renamed the tiles dir to pixmaps

2000-10-27 14:51  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/game.c: 
	- Fixed little bug with the units power (Displayed '2' for Spy, '3'
	for Scout,  etc)

2000-10-26 18:50  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combat.glade, combat.h,
	game.c, game.h, interface.c: 
	- Displays a little message when the server protocol is different
	from the      client protocol - Correctly receives and analyzes a
	sync message - Added a "Request Sync" item at the menubar -
	Requests game sync when the "Request Sync" menu is clicked

2000-10-22 19:43  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/game.c: 
	- Added a status message with the outcome of the attacks (who won,
	who lose)

2000-10-22 10:37  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: combat.c, combat.h, game.c: 
	- Added the common functions to check if a move is valid (in
	combat.[ch]) - Now uses this functions to check if it should send
	the move to the server

2000-10-21 10:46  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, combat.glade, game.c, game.h,
	gtk_player_info.c, interface.c: 
	- Fixed the -1/1 bug (When you were attacked by a unit of same
	power and both	 died) - When updating the unit list, it oesn't
	clears the entire list and insert it	 all again. Now it only
	changes one collumn. (So it remembers the previous	 selection)
	- Rewrote the setup subroutines. Now it should work a lot better -
	Added a small statusbar, next to the main statusbar, with the
	current turn							   
						- Removed the horizontal
	scrollbar from the unit list					   
								   (I don't
	think anyone will need it, and it occupied			   
									   
	       space)

2000-10-20 18:50  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: combat.h, game.c, game.h: 
	- Now handles user input in the moving state	- Selects the
	current unit	  - Selects where it is going to move / who it is
	going to attack 	- Sends a CBT_REQ_MOVE	(Must add some
	sanity checks) - Receives CBT_MSG_MOVE or CBT_MSG_ATTACK from the
	server and do the moving       logic - Some minor bug fixes	   
			   - Receives a CBT_MSG_GAMEOVER from the server
	and ends the game

2000-10-19 14:07  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combat.glade, combat.h,
	game.c, game.h, interface.c: 
	- Honors the server CBT_REQ_SETUP request for setup - Sends setup
	to the server - Receives a CBT_MSG_START message (starts the game)
	- Minor bugfixes

2000-10-15 13:33  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combat.glade, combat.h,
	game.c, game.h, gtk_player_info.c, interface.c, main.c: 
	- Some small improvements on the tiles (all of them have the same
	size and      now have a small id on their side) - Gets player
	names from the server (and display them) - Improvements on the
	drawing subroutines (all of them respect the tiles     
	transparency) - Allow user to setup his pieces (but can't send them
	to the server yet)

2000-10-14 13:44  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: callbacks.c, combat.glade, game.c, game.h, interface.c: 
	- Added some (very!) experimental tiles, so that we can continue
	the client development - Loads the tiles and display them on the
	board	      (Note: ggz must be running from the combat dir or it
	won't work)

2000-10-13 23:23  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: .cvsignore, gtk_player_info.c: 
	- Forgot to add this files before... ops! :)

2000-10-13 22:02  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* combat/: Makefile.am, callbacks.c, callbacks.h, combat.c,
	combat.glade, game.c, game.h, interface.c, main.c: 
	- Interface is almost looking as planned - Dinamically loads
	information of each players army - Display army information (sent
	by the server) in the columm list - Draws the tiles in the main
	area (but don't fill them yet)

2000-10-13 14:52  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, combat/Makefile.am, combat/callbacks.c,
	combat/callbacks.h, combat/combat.c, combat/combat.glade,
	combat/combat.h, combat/game.c, combat/game.h, combat/interface.c,
	combat/interface.h, combat/main.c, combat/support.c,
	combat/support.h: 
	- Makefile.am now creates a Makefile.in for Combat - Initial files
	for the Combat game module gtk client. Already implemented:  -
	Experimental interface (Built with Glade)	      - Only
	loads... nothing is working for now	 - Receives game info from
	the server (seat number, protocol version, etc)       - Honors a
	request for the game options		     - Sends default
	options (10x10 map, 40 initial units)	- Receives the options from
	the server

	* dots/Makefile.am, lapocha/Makefile.am, reversi/Makefile.am,
	spades/Makefile.am, tictactoe/Makefile.am: 
	- Bunch of autoconf/automake changes to accomodate easysock
	detection   and build it internally if not found

2000-10-09 19:22  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/main_win.c: 
	- Fixed bug that caused a X error when resizing window - Only shows
	the "Play again" button when game is over

2000-10-08 14:44  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: game.h, main.c, main_win.c: 
	- Sends a RVR_REQ_AGAIN message (play again feature) - Added a play
	again button

2000-09-27 15:54  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: game.h, main.c, main_win.c, reversi.dsc: 
	- Shows last played move - Changed the version to 0.1 (0.0.1 isn't
	fair to the lots of changes the module recently received)

2000-09-27 15:14  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: .cvsignore, dot.xpm: 
	- Added .libs to .cvsignore - Added dot.xpm (xpm used to mark the
	possible moves). Forgot to add it before!

2000-09-27 14:44  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: TODO, game.h, main_win.c: 
	- Shows possible moves for the current player

2000-09-27 12:59  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: TODO, black.xpm, game.h, main.c, main_win.c, white.xpm:
	
	- Added transparency effect to pixmaps - Changed pixmap files to
	other ones, bigger and better looking - Added two labels with the
	current score - Fixed bug when calculating score (the same of the
	server). Now do it by hand, square by square

2000-09-25 15:39  Ismael Orenstein <perdig@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: game.h, main.c, main_win.c: 
	- Added RVR_REQ_SYNC to protocol (client requesting sync) -
	Connected the Resync menu to request sync - Accepts sync from the
	server (changes the current board and turn to the one the server
	said)

2000-09-24 18:01  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* reversi/: Makefile, Makefile.am: 
	- Put Makefile.am in CVS, not Makefile.  Oops!

2000-09-24 17:57  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	reversi/support.h, reversi/white.xpm: 
	- Added reversi client game module from Ismael Orenstein

2000-09-04 06:28  bugg

	* dots/main.c, lapocha/main.c, spades/client_func.c,
	tictactoe/main.c: Shuffle the header files around so we can build
	ggz (no ggzd yet) on the BSDs. ggz may now be built like such:
	
	curly% GTK_CONFIG="/usr/X11R6/bin/gtk12-config" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
	./autogen.sh
	
	The CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are so it can find popt.h and -lpopt,
	respectively.  It would be nice if they searched here as well by
	default, so you'd only have to specify the location of
	gtk12-config.

2000-08-30 17:40  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/spades.dsc, tictactoe/ttt.dsc:

2000-08-17 23:08  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: game.h, main.c, table.c, table.h: server   - Alter
	MSG_HAND protocol to send a char representing dealer's seat
	
	client	 - Display dealer's seat with a (D) after name	 - Display
	current bidder's seat with a (B) after name ((DB) if dealer too)

2000-08-17 22:20  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/main.c: - This should fix the animation bug some have
	noted after a trick is taken

	* lapocha/: cb_main.c, cb_main.h, dlg_main.c, main.c, table.c,
	table.h: - This update fixes the segfaults that occured when the
	Gtk theme is changed   while an LP game is in progress

2000-08-14 22:33  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/docs.html: - Basic La Pocha documentation in HTML (thanks
	Austin!)

	dlg_new.c, dlg_new.h, dlg_opt.c, dlg_opt.h, game.c, game.h, main.c,
	main.h: - Added license notice

2000-07-28 00:29  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, main.c: - Commented out move-ahead of server
	response support   - This seems to cause some undesirable effects
	which are difficult to debug	 as it only happens when a server
	is lagged (which fortunately doesn't	 happen locally, although
	it'd make debugging easier :)

2000-07-28 00:08  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/main.c: - Print winner at end of game

2000-07-27 23:40  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	choice on LP_REQ_TRUMP from server

2000-07-26 02:12  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: game.c, game.h, hand.h, main.c, table.c, table.h: First
	(semi)playable version of La Pocha
	
	WHAT WORKS ---------- - Cards are dealt out properly, per rules -
	deal passes to the right - Trump is chosen by cutting the remainder
	of the deck in a random fashion - Bidding is properly dealt with,
	per the rules - to the left - Trick play is properly dealt with,
	cards must be played by the rules - End of hand play is properly
	dealt with, score calculated and sent to clients
	
	WHAT DOESN'T WORK ----------------- - Leave/Rejoin is not
	functional (and is going to be hell to implement) - Hands which use
	the full deck will not function (could crash? not sure)   - Don't
	play past the hand where 9 cards are dealt ;) - End of game is not
	detected

2000-07-23 21:04  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: game.h, hand.c, table.c: - Improved card display
	handling

2000-07-23 18:21  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: Makefile.am, cb_bid.c, cb_bid.h, dlg_bid.c, dlg_bid.h,
	dlg_main.c, game.c, game.h, main.c, table.c, table.h: - Players are
	now displayed in proper seats - Receive trump suit from server -
	Handle bid requests, sends and replies - Display opponent bids

2000-07-23 12:08  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, main.c: - Updated client to receive (and throw
	away since we don't need it)   the score information from server

2000-06-29 23:18  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: game.h, hand.c, hand.h, main.c, main.h, table.c,
	table.h: Initial checkin of La Pocha server.
	
	Current status: - Clients can connect and a sample 10 cards are
	dealt by the server.  - No game play is functional.  - Player one
	is told to play (so card animation can still be tested)
	
	Bugs: - Far far too numerous to mention, but nothing that appears
	to make either	 server or client unstable

2000-06-26 23:05  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/table.c: - Fixed card selection bug mentioned on ggz-dev
	- Added labels to appropriate positions in info boxes

2000-06-26 21:15  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lapocha/: dlg_main.c, table.c: - Resized table display to be

	checkin of LaPocha

2000-06-24 17:59  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/main_win.c: 
	- Took out a straggling debug comment in ttt - Lengthened usename
	entry box on login dialog and allow 16 chars - Work around buggy
	Gtk combo box by disabling profile combo if there   are no profiles
	- Create swappable top panel (notbook without tabs) for login
	dialog	 to use on login errors

2000-06-23 22:54  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/game.h:

	- Remove some debugging information

2000-06-08 22:07  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: Makefile.am, cb_main.c, cb_main.h, cb_new.c, cb_new.h,
	dlg_main.c, dlg_new.c, dlg_new.h, dlg_opt.c, game.h, main.c,
	main.h: - Pop up a dialog asking if you want to play another game -
	Added new OPCODE - DOTS_REQ_NEWGAME

2000-06-06 21:40  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: cb_opt.c, game.h, main.c: - Always display main dialog on
	startup - Wait for DOTS_REQ_OPTIONS to display options dialog - We
	will receive a DOTS_MSG_OPTIONS even if we are the launcher

2000-06-06 01:35  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/game.h: - Moved DOTS_SND_OPTIONS to client->server portion
	of protocol where it belongs

2000-06-06 01:01  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.h, main.c: Updated client to work with new launch
	protocol
	
	- Send DOTS_SND_OPTIONS (9) opcode to send options to game server

2000-05-21 22:41  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/socketfunc.h, tictactoe/main.c: 
	- Updated client to comply with protocol version 1: - Let game
	client modules handle options - Don't launch game module client
	until after receiving	RSP_TABLE_{LAUNCH, JOIN} - Use support
	function lookup_widget() in a few more places

2000-05-13 13:33  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/Makefile.am, spades/Makefile.am, tictactoe/Makefile.am: 
	- s/ggzmod/ggzexecmod/g; so we can use 'make install-exec' - Use
	ggzexecmod_PROGRAMS target for ggz.dots

2000-05-13 01:18  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: Makefile.am, cb_main.c, dlg_about.c, dlg_about.h: -

	Notify via statusbar on player join and leave

2000-05-10 23:59  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, game.h, main.c: Completed implementation of
	DOTS_SND_SYNC
	
	Server: - Keep track of owned squares and send them as part of
	DOTS_SND_SYNC
	
	Client: - After receiving DOTS_SND_SYNC, call board_redraw() to
	display game - Implemented board_redraw() to draw all lines and
	owned squares

2000-05-10 02:34  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, main.c, main.h: DOTS_SND_SYNC handled by client
	(protocol will change shortly)
	
	- Client can now leave and rejoin game - Board is not redrawn with
	proper lines/boxes on rejoin but plays properly

2000-05-09 19:46  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: cb_opt.c, game.h, main.c: Altered CtD protocol to always
	send DOTS_MSG_OPTIONS
	
	- Removed DOTS_REQ_OPTIONS - Renamed DOTS_RSP_OPTIONS ->
	DOTS_MSG_OPTIONS - Send DOTS_MSG_OPTIONS to joining board, before
	SYNC is sent

2000-05-08 21:10  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: dlg_main.c, game.c, game.h, main.c: - Fixed a minor label
	glitch - Game move-ahead (before server response) should be more
	reliable

2000-05-08 10:59  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/cb_opt.c: Convert the square size (from opt dialog) to dot
	size before sending to server

2000-05-07 14:40  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: dlg_main.c, game.c, main.c, main.h: - Player names appear
	on score frames - Scores are now updated in the score boxes

2000-05-06 23:34  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: Makefile.am, callbacks.c, callbacks.h, cb_main.c,
	cb_main.h, cb_opt.c, cb_opt.h, dlg_main.c, dlg_main.h, dlg_opt.c,
	dlg_opt.h, game.c, interface.c, interface.h, main.c, main.h: Added
	options dialog and reorganized the code a bit

2000-04-30 21:01  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/dots.dsc: - Added dots description file

2000-04-30 14:39  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, main.c, main.h: Can now play a full game of CtD
	
	- game over message handled, prints winner in statusbar - player
	turns are now updated properly in all cases

2000-04-29 13:11  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: game.c, game.h, main.c: Connect the Dots getting ever
	closer
	
	- Games now launch, moves are sent to server   (don't know what
	happens if you include a bot - DDT cuz there are no bots) - Server
	calculates moves and responds to both clients - Turn processing not
	handled just right yet (sometimes it's both players turn!) - Game
	leaves ghost at end of game (clients don't handle EOG yet)

2000-04-28 00:24  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dots/: Makefile.am, callbacks.c, game.c, game.h, main.c, main.h:
	Beginning to make client work with server
	
	- Don't launch games yet, they won't work!

2000-04-27 00:02  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, dots/.cvsignore, dots/Makefile.am, dots/callbacks.c,
	dots/callbacks.h, dots/game.c, dots/game.h, dots/interface.c,
	dots/interface.h, dots/main.c, dots/main.h, dots/support.c,
	dots/support.h: Adding Connect the Dots game to CVS
	
	- No server yet - Can't play a game, just see the UI ^_^

2000-04-20 19:29  Rich Gade <rgade@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/Makefile.am: Include x.xpm and o.xpm in a 'make dist'

2000-04-20 01:15  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/.cvsignore, spades/Makefile.am, spades/spades.dsc,
	tictactoe/.cvsignore, tictactoe/Makefile.am, tictactoe/ttt.dsc: 
	- Some about box touchups - Default to port 5688 like server -
	Don't hardcode game paths, read them from rc file - Re-did autoconf
	so that 'make install' works

2000-04-11 13:51  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/: Makefile.am, game.h, main.c, main_win.c, main_win.h: 
	- Reworked some internals, putting global vars into a struct - Keep
	a state variable: INIT, WAIT, MOVE, and DONE - Only accept input
	from user if in MOVE state

2000-04-07 14:14  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/: main.c, main_win.c, main_win.h: 
	- Moved pixmap init stuff into main_win.c in a callback for
	main_win   realize - Fixed up synchronization.	- Moved most
	logging messages to status bar

2000-04-06 11:04  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/: Makefile.am, main.c, main_win.c, main_win.h, o.xpm,
	support.c, support.h, x.xpm: 
	- Simple GTK GUI hacked onto existing hack of a text client :)

2000-04-05 17:34  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tictactoe/: Makefile.am, main.c: 
	- Simple text-based hack for playing tictactoe

2000-03-31 19:32  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, tictactoe/.cvsignore, tictactoe/Makefile.am,
	tictactoe/main.c: 
	- Added stub tictactoe client

2000-03-31 19:14  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: client_func.c, client_main.c: 
	- Use Unix domain sockets for talking with game client modules. 
	This   allows the game module to have access to stdin and stdout.

2000-03-30 02:19  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/callbacks.c: 
	- Don't send ai to GGZ.  That's silly

2000-03-04 18:10  Justin Zaun <jzaun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/gtk_dlg_options.c: 
	- Commented out the gtk_widget_show call for the computer/human
	seating tab of the - spades options dialog.

2000-03-01 19:15  Justin Zaun <jzaun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/gtk_io.c: 
	- commented out the gtk_show call for taunt area. Spades now takes
	up much less room on the screen

2000-02-29 10:10  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/Makefile.am: 
	- Replace 'SUBDIRS =' with 'SUBDIRS = .'  Seems make dist chokes if
	  SUBDIRS is empty

2000-02-08 09:55  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: callbacks.c, client.h, client_func.c, client_main.c,
	gtk_connect.c: 
	- Fixed spades client to accept '-o' option if player needs to	
	set game options (and don't ask for them otherwise) - Display main
	window earlier (so it looks like we're doing something)

2000-02-05 15:45  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: Makefile.am, all-cards.xpm: 
	- Oops, forgot a couple

2000-02-05 15:43  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* spades/: .cvsignore, callbacks.c, callbacks.h, card.c, card.h,

	gtk_taunt.c, gtk_taunt.h, gtkspinbutton.c, gtkspinbutton.h,
	options.h, socketfunc.c, socketfunc.h: 
	- Added files from spades client as a temporary hack (sigh).

2000-01-29 13:36  Brent Hendricks <bmh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore, Makefile.am: 
	- Added files
