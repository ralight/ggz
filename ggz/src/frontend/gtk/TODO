Current
-------

	GUI
	---
	* Padding around the room label
	* Left align the room label
	* More padding around the edges of client_hbox

	Interaction
	-----------
	- Double-Click to enter room

	Implimentation
	--------------
	* provide access to the ggzcore internal file 
	  descriptors so we can just add them to the
	  gtk/KDE event loop directly
	* rename callbacks to filename_ rather than on_
	* statically declare callbacks and local function in .c files
	* sensitivity within ggzcore event callbacks
