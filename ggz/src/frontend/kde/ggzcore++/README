GGZCore++
A C++ Class Library providing ggzcore wrapper functions
Current version: 0.1
=======================================================

Welcome humble GGZ Core Client programmers.
(In case you feel you don't belong into that group you are probably reading
the wrong README file, but I would please you to read on anyway.)

This is the first release of GGZCore++. As of today I know only 2 applications
which make use of it, these are KGGZ and GGZap, both from my own - ha!
However, I'd like to see a C++ Gtk frontend one day, or one created with yet another
toolkit than the Qt/KDE libraries.

What is already included? I tried to document each of the functions as accurate as possible.
If in doubt you should consult the file ggzcore.h which is also well documented, mostly
the ggzcore_conf functions.
And feel free to send me mails if there are still any questions.

The next release will most certainly contain a little example written for the console
(nope, no ggz-txt copy, rather less functional), but this depends on how much time
I'll have the next days and weeks.

How to build the library? Just fetch a recent GGZ copy from CVS:
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ggz.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/GGZ co ggz

...and copy the GGZCore++ src/ directory into it. Don't forget to add it to SUBDIRS
(named ggzcorepp or whatever) and that's all.

Now: go on coding!
