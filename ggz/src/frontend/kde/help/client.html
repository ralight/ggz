Here are some hints for you to become familiar with this client. If you read this text, it should already be running, so no problem here.
<UL>
<LI>At first you have to connect to a game server, which can run at localhost or somewhere on the internet, please have a look at the GGZ
homepage for details.
<LI>When connected, the chat window appears. It does not show anything on startup, because you have to select a room first. Every room
corresponds to one game, so have a look at the games list, where you can then select a room in the submenu.
<LI>Now you should see all the other players hanging around the rooms, waiting only for you to launch a game...
