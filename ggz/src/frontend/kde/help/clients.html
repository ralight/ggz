There exist two main clients for ggz: The original one (Gtk+), and the KDE port. There is also
a text-based client which you can use to chat with other gamers as well.
<BR><BR>
Both graphical clients contain a chat as the central widget. This is very important because you'll
have a lot of things to tell to the others. From within the chat, game sessions are arranged, launched
and finally won or lost. The chat is room-based, which means that if you're in another room you are going
to chat to different persons.
