Small design guide for all KDE-related parts of KGGZ;
for the more general functions, please refer to the GGZ style guide.

* Don't destroy the makefile. It should be usable for both ggz-cvs and independent packages.
* Use static member functions (or replace them as a whole) for inter-object communication.
* Reuse existing code as much as possible (e.g. use subclasses).
* Always think of users who run it on small systems (how's the look without pixmaps and themes?).
  There are useful compiler switches for scalability.
* Integrate the libggzcore functions properly.
* Use KDE classes if they are available, else use Qt classes. Don't use Qt's non-widget functionality
  too much if it is avoidable (e.g. QString...).
* Write documented, human-readable code.
* Slot functions should start with slotSomething, signals with signalSomething...
* Help me remember the above phrases.

This is the structure of the KGGZ classes (more recent than the HTML docs):
