important:
-games launching/configuring

features i'd like to see in kggz:
-when player clicks on link in the chat, optionally switch to browser
-kggz_embedded (resizeable widgets like chat, player list, rooms list + in-client scalable games (e.g. 3d))
-provide hyperlinks (URLs and email) in games list
-game updates via FTP work properly (in combination with ggz-config)
-some more KDE games for GGZ (like GGZilla, hehe)
-smaller icons
-grubby dialog functionality
-edit servers (kggz_profiles)
