- Reimplement net functionality as its own object

- Finish GGZGame and table launching functionality

- Fix the player/table pointing problem

- Convert to ggzcore_strdup()

- Provide a GGZ_AUTOLOAD option to automatically load room and type
  lists (and motd?) upon logging in and the player and table lists
  upon entering a room.

- Allow option for non-blocking socket: to make this easier, the
  protocol could be altered so that each message sends its length in
  bytes right after the opcode.  This is also easier if there are no
  "conditionals" in the messages.  The verbose information can be
  obtained in a separate message


- rather than permanently having a callback for events like
  SERVER_ROOM_CHANGE, we will register one when the client makes a
  request for a room change.  This hook then gets removed after it is
  called.  We can use this mechanism to pass information such as
  whether a verbose listing was requested, or what room was requested
  (this is really a frontend TODO)
