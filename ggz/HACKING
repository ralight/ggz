Hacking on GGZ
--------------

Eventually this file will describe the coding style we use on the GGZ
project.  For now, try to follow a few simple guidelines:

- Don't check in untested code!  Ever! 
- Try to match the coding style of the file you're working in
- Follow the Linux kernel coding style as much as possible (K&R style
  brackets, and 8 space indentation)  If you are using emacs, use the
  following commands:
  (set-c-style "K&R")
  (setq c-basic-offset 8)


If you are looking for things to work on, look at the TODO file, and
ask on ggz-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.  SourceForge hosts our project
so if you want to do any serious development, you'll need an account
there.
