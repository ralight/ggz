Announcing the release of The Gnu Gaming Zone v0.0.1!

The Gnu Gaming Zone (GGZ) is a an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players.
GGZ support multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players.

This is the first developers release of the code for GGZ.  It is meant
solely for feedback and information purposes.  It probably won't run
correctly, and may not even compile.  Most of the features are absent.

Then why release?  Because we're holding to the Free Software
guideline of "Release Early.  Release Often." We'd like to get more
eyeballs on the code than just our own. Also, since GGZ is designed to
be an infrastructure for game developers to incorporate their games
into, this gives them a chance to looks things over.

For this first release, the important things to observe are in the main
GGZ server.  The basic architecture for handling players and game
tables is in place.  I have not done a large amount of client or game server
coding. Therefore, in order to test the GGZ server, I hacked my spades
client and server to work.  Please don't flame me too much for the messiness
:)

There is much more information about the server architecture in the
doc/html directory (or doc/txt if you prefer a plaintext document).
It is a lengthy document, but it should answer many questions about
the way the GGZ server works (or will work).
