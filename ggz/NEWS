After much discussion, the project team has decided on a name change. Given
that we are not planning on becoming an "official" Gnu project in the
foreseeable future, we are dropping the "Gnu" from "Gaming Zone" and changing
our name to the "GGZ Gaming Zone". The core project is and will remain under
the GPL/LGPL license, we just don't feel that being "official" is in our best
interests at this time. The software isn't changing one bit, just the name.

Note that it will be a while until the name change takes effect in all
subprojects, on the web page, etc...

Announcing the release of The Gnu Gaming Zone v0.0.3!

The Gnu Gaming Zone (GGZ) is a an open-sourced Internet gaming center.
Similar to other online gaming sites, players login and sit at tables
where they can play their favorite games and chat with other players.
GGZ supports multiple rooms with varying skill levels, and records your
statistics so you can see how you match up against other players (at
least it will someday!)

This is the third developers release of the code for GGZ.  It is
still meant mainly for feedback and information purposes.  Many of the
features are still absent, but a few areas have had significant
improvement.

Changes since the last version:
- 2 new games: Connect the Dots and La Pocha!
- Player database
- Server profiles
- Private messages
- Much smaller memory footprint
- New event-based update system
