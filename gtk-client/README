=================================
The GGZ Gaming Zone - GTK+ Client
=================================

The GGZ Gaming Zone GTK+ Client provides a GTK+ 1.2 or GTK+ 2.x user
interface for logging into a GGZ server, chatting with other players,
and locating and launching game tables.

This version of the GTK+ Client (0.0.13) requires version 0.0.13 of the
ggz-client-libs.

The GTK+ Client module is only one part of the GGZ Gaming Zone client
setup.  The following additional packages are required:
  * libggz - provides commonly used functions and low-level
    communications between client modules and the GGZ servers
  * ggz-client-libs -  provides common procedures and utilites required
    to run the GGZ client and games
  * gtk-games/kde-games/sdl-games - one or more games or game packs are
    required in order to launch and play games

In addition, the following package is available:
  * kde-client - a KDE version of the GGZ client is also available
    in order to login to a server, chat and launch games

The order in which these components are compiled and installed is very
important.  See the README.GGZ file for complete information on
compiling the GGZ client system.

If you encounter any bugs or have difficulty compiling, please report bugs
via the bug tracker on our SourceForge project page, or send an email to the
developer's mailing list.
